Msanza,1.0 out of 5 stars,No response from tech support,"The built in print driver on my Fire HD 8 could not find my old Brother printer. I needed something else and I found this which claimed to support my exact printer. I was not fooled like other reviewers. I knew this app was not free. First I downloaded the free app and ran a print test page. The test page color pattern came out fine. Success! Then I paid for the upgrade to the full version to print real documents. But no matter what I do, it prints only the first page and then stops. I sent email to tech support and asked for help or a refund. Nothing. Not even a reply to say they could not help me.I have seen other reviewers says that it works for them. That is great, but it definitely did not work for me and I got no help from them... not even an acknowledgement. If this is the kind of customer service they offer, all I can say is buyer beware! The test page in the free app does not guarantee that it will print real docs for you....",Customer Support and Responsiveness

Mr Wizard,1.0 out of 5 stars,BOY DO I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE,"CAPITALIZATION in this review is NOT screaming ... just highlighting ...My initial ""review to myself"" was positive, when I tested a plain, short ""Word"" style document. It seemed to work just fine, and NOBODY releases software that doesn't work do they? snort!!! So I bought the program, and BOY! am I SORRY! that I did so, because I can now no longer get a refund as I have struggled SO long and SO hard, trying to make this piece of software do the simplest tasks.There is SO much of this app that either just plain does not work, or has VERY limited functionality, or does not work quite right, that I CANNOT in good conscience recommend this app to ANYONE for ANY reason.I have written to Support twice, and beyond the ""We have received your request..."" email notice, I have received NO response whatsoever to my request for assistance or clarification.The so called HELP system is more a list of what the menu options are than they are instructions on how to use this app. As a help system, it is WOEFULLY, and PITIFULLY inadequate. So mix the fact that parts of it, despite being available to the user, just do not work, the lack of reliable support and the lack of a comprehensive help system, and you get a miserable, FAILED attempt at a piece of software that should not have gone to market for a SIGNIFICANT additional period of time for development.And when I bought this, my ONLY option was a subscription so that I have to pay for it again, and AGAIN, EVERY year. What the heck happened to just being able to BUY a piece of software?These people need a couple of million bucks of investment money so that they can do some more development on this software so that it WORKS, and works COMPLETELY before they start selling it. As it stands, it needs a LOT more development. While SOME small parts of it DO work, it is NOT a replacement for microsoft office. There is just too much of it that does not work to warrant buying this app.I just CANNOT imagine a greater waste of money.

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",Compatibility and Device Issues
ijess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.

AutumnElf,1.0 out of 5 stars,The app looks nice but!,"I was looking forward to using this app, based on some reviews. Finally one place to compile all my recipes! Alas, there is one huge flaw with this app...there is no backup or storage of your recipes in the Cloud.  Lose or change your device and your data goes with it, unless you back it up. But you know you will slack on backing this up regularly, offline. So much management. Additionally the larger your recipe stash gets, the more space is eaten up on your device.  Also don't expect there to be sync'ing between your phone and tablet for example, since there is no cloud storage or account to login to and sync.I will save and revisit this app at a later date.

Elizabeth A.,1.0 out of 5 stars,$20 PER YEAR AND Different PRO features for different platforms? No thanks,"I'm very disappointed in this. This has great reviews, but it's really not all that great. I registered on my kindle. I went to the website to input all my recipes (there's only about 50, so I have room on the free account) from my browser bookmarks. But the ""CLIP"" feature on the website is only for PRO users. But I can enter them in all by hand. On the Kindle app, it's opposite. The CLIP feature is free and the manual entry is a PRO feature. So now, what I wanted it for, it's useless unless I want to spend a few hours inputting everything. There's no reason why the PRO features should be different from one platform to the next if you're offering a sync method to begin with. On top of all of that, I didn't realize it was $20 A YEAR.

Enjoy the frequent buffering and frame skipping of an inferior product that will never be mentioned in the same breath of a ChromeCast, Apple TV, or Firestick. But who values reliability and quality anyways? Being constant is dull. AirBeam TV keeps things FRESH by spontaneously throwing in wrenches into your streamed content. This app will take your favorite videos and movies, and mindlessly chop-and-screw it until it devolves into a hot/disheveled mess that once resembled your original content. But hey, everyone loves a good remix. Remixes are awesome and always better than the original!And if you enjoy horrible customer service, you can always count on AirBeam TV to not be there for you. If you had questions or comments about the product, but are repulsed by the thought of talking to a human being, AirBeam TV will gladly send you through an infinite loop of automated responses while deferring all blame to the user. It's not enough that I've restarted my computer and modem, closed all other extensions/applications, and checked the internet connection of my TV...I probably need to give up my left kidney and bladder too for my video content to be streamed without a hitch.AirBeam TV's connectivity strength and resolution may be inconsistent, but your disappointment with the product will remain constant over time!",Compatibility and Device Issues

Shaun V.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful when/if you cancel your subscription.,"I had Fubo for the 2021/22 hockey season. It was a decent streaming service, but no longer became worth the price when they increased the cost dramatically. I accidently ""paused"" the service at the end of the hockey season instead of canceling it and during the off season I found cheaper ways to watch hockey (NESN) so I decided not to restart the service. Little did I know they would restart the service 6 months later without any notice and charged me $80. I called customer service and they said there was nothing they could do and refused any sort of refund. I'm sure they have the terms written and I honestly just screwed up when pausing instead of canceling, but restarting the service without some kind of notice and charging me 6 months later has certainly put me off the service permanently. A simple heads up email before restating the service and charging me would have been a much more honest business approach.",Customer Support and Responsiveness

I called customer service & they told me that there was no problem with their app & I should ""just watch something else"".  I'm sure you can guess how that comment went over with a diehard ND fan... The next day he tried again, only this time I could not even get the app to load.  So I called customer service AGAIN, except this time I was not nearly as friendly.  I told them that I wanted the subscription cancelled & my credit card information destroyed.  They told me that I had to request cancellation via email... WHICH I DID!!  Fast forward two weeks.  They charged my credit card for the subscription, which I cancelled over the phone AND by email.  I AGAIN called customer service and was told that I had not cancelled the subscription, but that they would ""see if they could refund the money"".  It wasn't ling before they told me that they would not refund the money AND I had to go through the cancellation process again.  I disputed the charge with my credit card and informed my credit card company that if they attempted to charge my card again it was fraud & I wanted to press charges.

And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.

Paula-Gene,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely horrible interface and regular crashing,"I have had this service for over 8 months.  In that time, the amount of recorded shows that had technical difficulties and crashed without recording the rest of the episode or having to start all over and find where it crashed is substantial.  And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.  The frustration level with this service is way beyond what its worth at one of the highest price points of all streaming services.

Then it turns out that there is something called a premium version, and it is that version only that works with the dictionary. Apparently there is a premium version that is not the pro version because the spell check dictionary still says I must have the premium version. So I still can't use the spell checker dictionary. I now have an automatic subscription to a word processor that displays in what looks like 7 point type--seriously! maybe this software isn't intended for an android phone--and this subscription is automatic and a bargain ($9.95 a year).

Once I had the Kindle and downloaded the Skype program I called customer service to find out why I couldn't find the program on the Kindle.

ALSO, I bought a Kindle Fire HD for my granddaughter for Christmas only to find out it isn't the same as the Kindle Fire HD as mine, even though they were both purchased from Amazon and within 2 weeks of each other, the Kindle Fire HD protective case does not fit her Kindle HD.

Also lost all previous conversations and you don't receive new pictures, videos or messages. Plus you cannot contact Skype customer service, only their community page. NOT convenient, especially when it auto updates on some pc's and tablets. Apparently Skype has reformatted their platform, which effectively made many tablets, pc's and phones unsupported by the new version. Skype says Amazon version 7.3 is supported, however then why are conversations not coming through?Without a way to communicate with customer service you have no avenue to address the loss of $60.00 annual fee for services no longer available or supported.

I bought the Kindle specifically for my daughter to read books and Skype while she was on her five month trip. We promptly got our purchase but were unable to open the download of the Skype app. We phoned for technical support and the agent went through the download process with us. It did not work. The agent was aware that I had read a number of product reviews that the new Kindle Fire was capable of Skype. They thought there might be a licensing issue and that they would make my concern known and that someone would contact me with an answer on way or another with in a week or so.. That was December 19th and no one ever did. I could have returned the Kindle and gotten another tablet if I had known. I think that Kindle/Amazon should be dealing with this discrepency and communicating what the issues are rather than avoiding a customer. I am a new Amzon user (first purchase was a Kinndle) and I don't feel that the customer service reflects the amount of emails I am receiving promoting specials etc. Maybe the company should focus on keeping customers by responding to issues.,Customer Support and Responsiveness

andropolis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype compromises privacy and allows for exploits to back door into your computer,This program now has  Back doors which allow black hat hackers to get into your computer on the front end allowing them to control your computer without root. If left  On they can easily gain root access and steal your identity or Worse. When this operation  Started before Microsoft bought it this was a peer to peer application where no middle man can just access video and audio that is absolutely private. Now that Microsoft owns it they run it through their servers and keep your video and audio in possible perpetuity. I suggest anyone who has this program to audit it if you have the ability or just not use it. There are better applications out there that don't compromise your privacy.,Security and Privacy Concerns

James,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad port of a good service.,"The worst aspect of this app is that it continually fails to push messages from people. Often I will message someone only to suddenly have several messages sent to me hours before suddenly load. To the other people, it just appears I am ignoring them. Signing on to the desktop app at the same time will make the messages show up and be received immediately, but then what is the point of using the app if I have to use the desktop?The interface was already bad and they continue to make it worse with each update. Now contacts are separated into a long alphabetical directory rather than simply allowing you to see who is online at a glance. The desktop interface is fine, and I'm not sure why they feel the need to try and deviate from it.You cannot choose any status but online or invisible. Worse, you can't see if anyone else has their status set as away or busy. You simply see them as online, when in reality they may not want to be disturbed.The desktop program is fine.

tzot,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Buggy, buggy, buggy","OLD review: The pre-installed version on my fire HD was buggy: if I made the mistake of typing an IM, then any subsequent calls was a matter of chance whether they would happen. Even if it crashed, I just had to reopen Skype. However, as long as a call (either voice or video) was active, the thing worked. I saw there was an update, so I gladly installed it. Disaster ensued. Video calls are flaky and the app crashes frequently; as soon as it crashes, only a tablet reboot will release the camera device; it remains locked/stuck/whatever and any app trying to use the camera hangs.I would like to downgrade to the previous version but I can't (or don't know how to).

Allen F.  & Virginia S.  Capel,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work for me,"This will be my third Skype account.  So far none of them work properly.  My first attempt with Skype was about five years ago and it worked perfectly.  Since then, it is constantly degraded to the point where I get garbled sound and no video.  I thought by having it on my Kindle.  My problem would be resolved.  No such luck.  I think Skype just does not like me.  I know it is not my Internet connection because the next step up would be to full commercial satellite receiving.  It does work okay for instant message, though, but that's not why I bought it.  Yes, I even purchased an upgrade version for my computer and it still does not work.  Skype and me just don't agree.  I sure hope someone from Skype reads this review and offers me some help because their customer service is probably the worst in the industry",Customer Support and Responsiveness

You used to be able to change your status from online to away or invisible or offline....now you can't.  You're online as long it's running and have to completely shut down the kindle to turn it off.  Before this update I rated this at about a 5*....now that's no longer friendly to use at all it's down to 2*....and that's being generous.

Dauphinty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a working app.  Will not allow area code to be entered,"I am really peeved that the Skype download for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 does not allow for you to add the area/local code, so that you can obtain a number for your device on the local network.  This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.  Nothing I did corrected the problem.  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.  Had I known it was useless I would have spent my money on the Ipad, but i figured all i needed was to video chat and didn't need to have a camera on the back for vidoes and pictures that the Ipad includes.

Very happy customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Some things to note about the latest Skype version,"I have had a 32GB 8.9 HD kindle since it first came out in late 2012 & some earlier models. If you read through many of the reviews you should notice that most of the 5 star ones were written shortly after the release of the HD series in late 2012 & early 2013. On the other hand, the poor 1 & 2 star reviews were written since late 2013 & later.I would agree with this as it matches my own experience. The original Skype for the Kindle Fire HD series worked very well but an update issued sometime late last year changed all of this. There appears to be two main issues:1. SOUND VOLUME:Even if your volume is set all of the way up before launching Skype, conversations are barely audible. This may be because MS/Skype expect you to use ear buds which is a common way to use the app. If you in fact do this then you will find the audio level to be okay. HOWEVER, if you don't use ear buds then check the volume setting within Skype using the hardware volume switch and you will probably notice that the volume is way down around 25%. If you raise the volume to 100% using the hardware volume control then conversations can be heard okay just like the earlier version and it stays this way in subsequent sessions. They may have made the initial setting this way to prevent ear bud users from blowing out their ears.2. CRASHES:I don't know what to say about this except to confirm that I have had the same experience. Skype starts okay but invariably crashes (frozen screen, no sound, etc.) within 5 minutes and will then the Kindle will spontaneously reboot. This makes what is otherwise an excellent app next to useless.So, this problem has been around for over 6 months without being fixed. Amazon gets a failing grade from me on this issue as they should at least make the original version available for download from their app store for folks having this problem while they are sorting out the issues with the latest version.",Performance and Stability

She showed us her app, we tried texting her, and nothing showed up. Instead someone else replied.I apologized to the other person and told them to notify their parents about this.

Bonner Sawyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The 6 month update, tldr = not free, more like ""Bugmeware!!!""","All the things I said before are true. The app works, the price for the ""No Add's"" version is high, to high unless you are using a fire tablet as a primary texting device. The App gets more of a ""PIA"" the longer you use it. Dire warnings that unless you text or call someone in the next ""X number of hours"" you will lose your number ! If This was after 6 months of more I could see it... But the way This App works it's like blackmail to keep your phone number... It became such a pain that I removed the app. This is why I made This edit and dropped my rating from 3 stars to 1Star.  I think the ""Free"" label is false advertising, Free Trial would be closer. If these folks came up with a tiered cost system it could be a workable texting app. But with the $14+ a month price just to use the app without adds or use it or lose it threats, it's not worth it for my use. Why they don't see that  a $20 a year for 250 texts a month or something like that would give them a larger user base and how hard is it to count texts? Software! They have to have This for billing and management anyway.  Look elsewhere if you are just looking for an app to send a text to share a story you found reading the Washington Post with a friend.This App works. It gave me a way to send Text messages from my ""Fire Tablet"" I wanted to be able to share some news articles without having to use email. I have not used the phone call function. What I don't like is the amount of ""Please upgrade!"" Messages... I know they have to pay for the service they provide and make at least some profit from the effort. I normally do buy the ""no adds"" version of any app I use. But the price these guys want is more than what I really use is worth. If you needed the phone call function and if it worked as good as the text function... The the price could be worth it. The only reason I used this app was I didn't want to add Google's play store to my fire, if not for that I would have just used my Google Voice account.",Functionality and Features

Kyle Heisler,2.0 out of 5 stars,A not so mobile mobile app.,"While the workflows for this app feel better than the PC version of the software, the app is severely limited by it's requirement for an internet connection.  I started using the app at work, which luckily has WiFi, however as my device has no cellular connectivity, I have been unable to use it during my recent travels, nor will I be able to use it to study during the 12+ hours it will take to fly Germany,With the Kindle Fire version of the App, the only apparent need for the internet connection is to sync your progress to the Rosetta Stone servers,  which is useful if you are going back and forth between your PC and mobile device while learning.  However, even this functionality does not work reliably; in my experience the App and PC only synced automatically every third or forth attempt.  While the PC has a force sync option this is not available on the mobile app so you are forced to restart the application through the device settings and hope that your PC synced properly at home.With these issues in mind and the fact that I like to use my Kindle while away from work or home, I wish the Rosetta Stone would have chosen a different method to generate a micro purchase income from their users; such as charging a one time fee to download the App, or charging for some of their more advanced online services.  The fact that I can't use the App as a a true mobile learning platform is endlessly irksome.I also wish that Rosetta stone had built in better orientation support for the app.  I have yet to figure out how the app is determining it's orientation for the session, but more often than not, the app will be incorrectly positioned in relation to how I wish to hold my device.  This is especially troublesome when attempting to use the app while charging the device.TL:DR - While the orientation problems with the app can be annoying, the biggest limiting factor is the requirement for an internet connection.  Which if you are using a device without cellular support effectively makes your mobile device about as portable as your home PC.",Functionality and Features

You can push through the lessons quickly on a tablet and the voice recognition on tablets seems to work really well. That's where the good traits end. I spent a lot of money on levels 1-5 (the French desktop application). 3 months of ""online"" access were included. That means in 3 months, I can't use this app anymore unless I pay even more money to access the features and course progress I have already paid for in the desktop version. If you're going to go with Rosetta Stone for learning another language, it's a great program. But don't count on being able to readily use this app. I believe you need another, separate subscription for any other languages you're learning (and have likely already paid for). The subscription is annual, so you will have to resubscribe every year if you plan on taking more than a year to learn the language or just want to brush up on your skills. Unless you're willing to pony up more dough for the subscription or just go with the online access itself and be willing to let that expire at some point, save yourself the trouble and get the desktop version.

Soon the error occurs again, and again I press play and again the hourglass stays on as I watch the program. My bandwidth is variable, but it isn't low. When I test it, I always find my test app sees 10 Mbps on the first run, 20 Mbps on the second, 24 Mbps on the run after that, and about 34 Mbps on a fourth test. So my impression is that my phone company (AT&T) always gives up to 10 Mbps a new stream, and then bumps it up if the demand continues. Also if I try streaming HD video on another devices or if I don't, it makes no difference in the TED app errors, and the video on the other devices works perfectly regardless of whether the TED app is running.  So I conclude the app isn't able to handle changes in throughput, even though all my other devices and apps (with one app exception) work fine.

Don Hendrickson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Less than impressed,"I studied German in college many years ago.  I selected the Duolingo German option.  I found it difficult to clearly hear each word that was spoken.  Too bad that native speakers cannot say a word slowly and distinctly, then say it as in normal conversation.  Also, just beginning, I found strange situations.  The word for ""boy"" in German is ""Der Knabe""..as a second choice ""Der Junge"".  Duolingo offers only the word ""Der Junge""...which generally means ""the youth""...and the article ""Der"" makes it male.

J. Walsh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but I expect more from the Food Network,"First, let me say that this is a good product, not great. It marginally improves upon the foodnetwork.com experience on a tablet. It does the basics of allowing you to search for recipes on foodnetwork.com by show as well as save those recipes into a recipe box that are linked to the website. However, the recipe box does not allow you to create folders, only store in folders you create on the website so a little less functionality than the website.A nice (but incomplete) feature allows you to create shopping lists from recipes. However the app does not combine ingredients from multiple recipes so you have a short, concise list. It should also allow you to scale recipes based on the number of servings you would like to make.Likely the biggest complaint is that it has even less video than the website (i.e., no video at all from what I found...) Given that this application is published by the Food NETWORK you would think that they would have lots of video to include.  Also, when shows have multiple recipes that are pared together, there are no links from one recipe to another meaning you have to find it on your own.The app itself runs ok. It did crash once on my Galaxy Note 10. In short, I'd wait for them to put in a serious upgrade until paying the $1.99...",Performance and Stability

BlessedCP,1.0 out of 5 stars,DOWNGRADED and updated my review,"I had to update my glowing review of this app because of the updates and changes they have made.  It is no longer user-friendly.  The ads, which were noticeable before, but small, are now annoying and often blocking area I want to read or edit. I absolutely love this app.  I have never had an app device before so I am new to this.  Because of frequent updates I lost my recipes numerous times.  They now have a subscription fee where you pay for a monthly or yearly subscription that expires, it is not cheap.  I would prefer to buy the app outright, that is not an option.I have since deleted this app from my device and found a different one.  I was SO, SO sad to let this one go.  It was my most used and favorite app on my Fire.Former review:  I cook differently than a lot of people focusing on healthy, fresh foods without the use of canned goods or processed foods.  These types of recipes are difficult to find in standard cookbooks and cooking sites.  But with Chef Tap I can read my favorite healthy cooking blog and instantly transport the recipe into Chef Tap, it is easy, painless and fast.  Editing is easy as there is an option to view the whole blog post and import any text that didn't make it into the recipe.You create your own tags and then you can add those tags to any recipe.  So I have my breakfast tag, beverage, salad, etc.  The recipes are searchable by its tag, but also by a title word.You can also add your own personal notes to any recipe which is a great way to make note of changes you made or even when it was prepared.I do have some wishes for the program:  I wish it did weekly menu planning including breakfasts.  I would also appreciate a generated shopping list.  And more than any other function I wish it could sync with a computer version and even a phone version.  I would LOVE this program on my browser.  Then I could STORE the recipes on my computer, but then access them from the Fire when I am in the kitchen.One of my biggest complaints is that the back-ups take a long time once you have several recipes in the program.  Additionally, the back-up runs automatically when you open the program so you can not access your recipes until it is finished backing up.  I would rather the back-up function operated in the background or even when the program isn't being used.  You can amend how you want the back-ups done and how frequently, which is helpful.My other complaint is that when you are making edits in your recipe you can't stay in an edit mode and have to click your options and start over for each step you edit.Overall it is the best recipe import program I have used including my experience with computer versions.",User Interface and UX
Cybele A. Baker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Down grading for changes to a paid subscription,"You can see my original review below this update.: what was once 4-5 star app has become a 2 star due to the change over to VERY expensive paid subscription if you want to have more than 100 recipes stored. Eleven to twelve dollars a year is ridiculous, I understand they need to make some money to be able to continue to improve and support this app but the cost is prohibitive to what this app does and I refuse to pay them their current fee just to store and import recipes from the internet. And I do not buy their excuse that there is no way they can afford to keep this app running without such a high cost. They do not need servers to store all our recipes, those get stored on our devices and do not cost them a dime. Yes they want to be able to fix bugs and make improvements but please do not insult my intelligence by saying they cannot afford to do it without having everyone shell out for their price. I have far more sophisticated apps on my devices that were free. Yes many of them are supported by larger companies but this program does not require as much tinkering at say a spreadsheet or WORD document writing apps. I might consider an annual fee that actually was fair(at least a 50% cut on their current fee would be smart.) but until that time I won't be upgrading and will just go back to how I used to do it with Pintrest.To sum up; in my opinion while this is a very nice app but it is not worth the price tag they set to upgrade to the ""pro"" version.Original 4 star review:I love this app it works very smoothly 80% of the time...I downloaded all my saved Pintrest recipes with very little corrections needed and adding new stuff is a snap. Where it loses a star is downloading from personal blogs like Blogger etc..I had to pretty much retype most of each recipe myself. Now some of this is probably due to the nature of my blog which has a lot of non recipe storytelling stuff mixed into my entries. But what bothered me was the random stuff this app did not load at all. I would rather it loaded my entire blog letting me delete what I did not want than for it to pick and choose what it wanted to collect.",Compatibility and Device Issues

Melissa J. Newman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"wanted to like this product, not for $15.99/year subscription fee","The customer service is horrible.  At first I thought the customer service was horrible, because I was not a paying customer.  So I decided to pay for a year to test out the product.  My youngest son wants to be a chef when he grows up, so I really wanted a great recipe tool.  So I paid my money, and reported the software bugs to the developer.  The programmer's bug fix completed trashed my database.  Images on my tablet were deleted, and all changes that I did to recipes on my tablet were erased.  I import recipes and then modify all of them to suit my family's needs.  Anyway, the programmer's response when I told him my database was trashed was to give me my money back (which I did not ask for), and to downgrade my account from a pro version (which I legitimately paid for) to a basic version (again, which I did not ask for).  Yes, once my database was trashed, I knew that I would never renew the subscription to this product.  But now I have to do it before I hit 100 recipes instead of having a year to find the right product.This product have too many bugs that can serious damage your database of recipes.  It is not worth the price, especially when the programmer wants you have to have a 20+ year relationship with his product.  Over 10 years, that is $156.  Over 20 years, it is over $300 for a simple database to store recipes.  After you reach 100 recipes in the database, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee of $15.99/year.  That is $156.00 over 10 years and over $300 over 20 years.The only software that I re-buy each year is tax software.  Everything else I pay for with a one-time fee, and I will upgrade when I believe that I need to upgrade.  If I need to synch my database on a cloud, I will do it on my own cloud.  I don't need or want to pay a yearly fee for each type of data I may want to back up on a cloud.I believe that programmers should get paid for software they develop, which is why when there is a paid version and a free version of a product for a tablet, I usually buy the paid version.

Enjoy the frequent buffering and frame skipping of an inferior product that will never be mentioned in the same breath of a ChromeCast, Apple TV, or Firestick. But who values reliability and quality anyways? Being constant is dull. AirBeam TV keeps things FRESH by spontaneously throwing in wrenches into your streamed content. This app will take your favorite videos and movies, and mindlessly chop-and-screw it until it devolves into a hot/disheveled mess that once resembled your original content. But hey, everyone loves a good remix. Remixes are awesome and always better than the original!And if you enjoy horrible customer service, you can always count on AirBeam TV to not be there for you. If you had questions or comments about the product, but are repulsed by the thought of talking to a human being, AirBeam TV will gladly send you through an infinite loop of automated responses while deferring all blame to the user. It's not enough that I've restarted my computer and modem, closed all other extensions/applications, and checked the internet connection of my TV...I probably need to give up my left kidney and bladder too for my video content to be streamed without a hitch.AirBeam TV's connectivity strength and resolution may be inconsistent, but your disappointment with the product will remain constant over time!",Compatibility and Device Issues

carrie s daly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device.",Functionality and Features

No way to ""enable ads"" and I already purchased the paid version! Doesn't work as free version, doesn't work as paid version. Don't waste your time.

Judebert,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unreliable, distressing, use better alternatives","Recommendation: Use AirReceiver insteadPicture is acceptable, but delayed by several seconds. Keeps warning me that my network is slow. Disconnects after 15 minutes or so to show an ad, requiring a reconnect from the projecting computer and occasionally restarting the app. Ad display is unreliable, in which case it asks you to purchase *a subscription* and waits for 15 seconds.The ad tries to guilt you into a purchase by claiming expensive server requirements. But Miracast is a Wi-Fi Direct connection, and AirPlay and Google Cast go straight to the display... so the servers are either collecting your data or serving ads. Either way it's a ridiculous cost.  (Possibly they're saving the ""recordings""? I don't want that.)We used AirReceiver and Chrome Cast's ""desktop"" source. It worked with much less delay, smoother video, no ads, no ""slow network"" warning, and stayed connected for hours with no issues.

JJCEO,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't  play live video when I first got the app but it does now! A CBS update may have fixed this original problem,"Update: 9-10-2017Well the latest app update removed the ability to watch a live NFL game on my digital projector. Dear CBS, you are going the wrong way. I pay for full cable TV and yet I can't stream a live game of my home team. My rating has gone from a 1 star to a 4 star and now back to a 1 star.Like many of these streaming apps they are tending to get worse rather than better in what they offer and in performance.Update:When I first got this app I tried for over a month to watch multiple sporting events and I could not stream any live sporting events. My primary interest was to watch the NFL games on CBS. Today I was in the basement working and I turned on the digital projector and the CBS Sports app and the NFL AFC playoff game was on line between the Patriots and the Pittsburg Steelers. It was streaming perfectly in HD quality with no issues. I have raised my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.I hope CBS keeps streaming live sports like this. This will make this app much more useful with my Amazon Fire TV stick. Many of the people that gave this app a poor rating should try to see if it is working now.  Thanks CBS for fixing this issue.----------------Original review:I have full cable service and I use multiple apps to play TV channel programs live on a wide screen projector in our entertainment room. Many of the apps for TV channels allow me to sign in and prove that I am a customer of a TV provider, like ATT U-verse, and it automatically lets my watch live video on the projector wirelessly. I use a Fire TV Stick to do this. This app will not let you watch live TV at all. For my purposes of watching an NFL game I find this app useless for my application.I find it amazing that so many other national channels allow you to stream live video for free once you register that you are paying for cable TV, but not CBS!  It shows a lot of bits and pieces of talk shows about sports that I don't  care about. This app for me is a 1 star and I would rate it lower if I could. CBS needs to catch up with its competitors and show live TV. ESPN, TNT, FOX, NBC, Disney, and ABC do it properly and there are other stations that also stream live TV. CBS needs to wake up and realize that this is 2016 and a digital world and not 1950!-------------So far the app is still working reasonably well.",Compatibility and Device Issues

On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming.

Blue11,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It has stereo audio only, like it's 1975 or something.","I got this for both my AppleTV4K and my Amazon Fire Stick 4K to see the Super Bowl in higher rez (1080p/60) with less compression than the overly compressed 720p garbage Spectrum Cable spews out. For whatever reason, it didn't work worth a damn on the Fire (unless you consider sub-VHS quality and constant freezing to be OK), and on the AppleTV4K, where it looked fantastic, it went less than 15 minutes before it crashed. I suspect the servers had far more traffic than Fox and whomever they hired to do the streaming expected.However, the MAJOR disappointment was that the audio on both hardware platforms was 2 channel stereo. Despite the highly compressed video performance, at least Spectrum had decent 5.1 surround audio. I wound up just watching on Spectrum Cable.I would not have even written this review except that I noticed the stereo audio a few days before the big show, and contacted Fox Sports tech support to ask why, and they couldn't make up their minds while I was on the phone whether to just be condescending, or condescending AND rude. As a television engineer (now retired) for 45 years who knows exactly what he's talking about, it was like dealing with the DMV without the warmth you get from the DMV.Seriously, Fox Sports, hire some competent support people and then train them to be less snarky, especially when someone calls to ask why the outfit handling the Super Bowl stream is only capable of two channel stereo.

No matter where I try to watch it, what platform I try to watch it on, if I am wireless, if I am hardwired into a network. The video ALWAYS ends up being crappy.  It will be a beautiful video for about 2 minutes and then it will spend the next 10 minutes being a blur of colors that you wouldn't even know what you were looking at had you not already been told.

Sometimes, if you wait for a minute or two, it will eventually start playing again for another 30 seconds, and then freezes again.In my experience, this is the WORST streaming app from any cable channel or broadcast network. I have such a negative attitude towards this app that it's bled over to my feelings about my FireTV Stick. Since the NBA season started this year, I've been using my FireTV Stick less and less and using my Roku more. Now, I almost never use my FireTV Stick. The only time try to use it when I try to watch the Mavericks play.  I noticed that I was using the Roku almost exclusively a while back, but I couldn't really figure out why. Outside of FSGO, I was using mostly the same apps on both devices.

There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.

James Altemus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Random commercials on certain channels are a feature, not a bug","We switched to fuboTV from another streaming service because the other service dropped a key channel for us. The service works well enough, though for a live sports-focused streaming service, the lack of anything ESPN and the lack of alternate/back channel functionality on the remote are curious choices, but something we've adapted to.What really bothers me about fuboTV is their ad delivery. fuboTV has figured out a way to insert ad breaks into live events like soccer, which are generally broadcast without commercial interruption. My issue is that they are using this technology on channels that run pre-recorded programming that already includes commercial breaks. For example, when my kids are watching a show Cartoon Network or Nick/Nick Jr., in the middle of a show segment an block of one or two ads for products not targeted to children (Geico, Red Lobster, etc.) will pop up. The show returns when the ads are complete, but since the technology doesn't pause the underlying program, part of it is lost. Keep in mind that this is in addition to the pre-set commercial breaks in the programs where they will sometime insert local or regional spots over the national spots. I've contacted fuboTV about this issue on a couple of occasions, and while they seem responsive and it does stop for a while, eventually it starts up again. At this point I'm convinced that this is by design.Fix these things and I'll stick with fuboTV.

Yours is so poor, I will probably not continue past the trial. There is no realtime guide onscreen during a broadcast, you hit the back button you go to a guide at the first listed channel, so you have to scroll down again and again. It buffers but no more than Direct TV and Hulu (Sling did not). I would love to use fubo but the interface was written by someone who obviously does not use it.I would rather pay more for a UI that you can navigate than this.

My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now.

My wife is from New England and is, like most of New Englanders, a fan of all their sports teams. I was excited that we had found a streaming app that gave us channels that made her feel at home. She even started to tear up when she saw a Shaw's commercial. Then our world crashed when I checked for the game time on the guide and discovered that all of the New England channels were removed. We were using her hometown zip as our home zip which the website promises that you can watch the regional channels of your home zip even if you aren't physically in that region. This is a lie. I called the support number and the person I talked to contradicted what the website said and keep explaining in circles. When I asked for a supervisor the rep kept trying to talk to me. After I kept repeating I wanted to talk to a supervisor the rep put me on hold and came back approximately 40 seconds later to tell me that a supervisor wasn't available.

The majority of the apps available, including for roku, the worst of them, are very poorly functional. On roku you can only watch live - no access to your DVR, prior games, or even to fast forward or go back. Plain simple live is the ONLY option.If you use chromecast or other way to use the app on a phone or tablet, it is slightly better, but as you cast to tv, the fast forward and all other commands no longer function, unless you stop casting.Then comes the worst part of it - say you recorded a game, or want to watch a game that happened a few hours ago. First, you need phone or app - again, no roku functionality (they have been on beta for over one year). Second, good luck watching it all. The app saves what they think is an average time for the game, and if it is a bit longer, you miss the end. On football and baseball, you reliably lose the end of the game more often than not as they record only 3 hours!!!!Bottomline, barely useful, and only for live games.",Functionality and Features

I canceled after 1 hour and still was put into that loop where you will get replies to emails where the goal may be to run out the clock on the 7 days.2.  VERY IMPORTANT - They will tell you that you have to cancel through the app, and that was easy enough to do. but thank god I didn't hit yes , i confirm I want to cancel, and look away from the screen as it went back to their home page.  A statement that really blended in with everything else and was only on for a second or two said that my cancellation was not successful.  This is where I knew it was a scam.  It should have given me an error when I hit that confirm button and not let me cancel or I should have gotten and email generated by the system stating that my cancellation was not successful and to please contact customer service.  Of course neither thing happened.  I can only imagine how many people have hit that button and looked away, went to a different tab quickly, or just didn't notice the hard to notice or because it was so fast thought it said that their cancellation was, instead was not, successful.If you are reading this before signing up with these people, unlike me, Don't!  Run and don't look back.And if you know you canceled through the app within the 7 days and still got billed, you are not crazy rather you were scammed.If you do cancel through customer service ask for a confirmation email and if you don't have one within 15 minutes call back.

Nina Steven,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pointless - The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.,"It seems Fubo has missed the point of the  cord-cutting ""targeted streaming content service"" trend. Or, at least, they want you to think it's cord cutting. Unlike NFL, NBA and MLB apps that offer the user the ability to focus on just the content they are after (baseball, hockey, US football), Fubo delivers packages of fairly low bandwidth sports streams that force you to channel surf in order to find the content you're looking for. (Let's face it, there are hundreds, if not thousands of football matches going on around the world all year long),The truth is, when you're forced to buy bundled packages that resemble what you are already paying for with traditional ""cable tv"", you've just exchanged one cord for another. For most people, internet and standard cabe tv use the same physical wire to the house. Using Fubo to stream the same channels means you are actually using a SLOWER (lower bandwidth & quality) stream to watch the same channels in lower quality. PLUS you are paying for the additional data/bandwidth usage that goes against your monthly allotment...- And before Fubo says ""but you can watch on computer or mobile device""; most cable providers already offer mobile apps or web access to live channels. Most major networks already offer mobile/web access to streaming content if you can prove you have a traditional cable tv contract. (NBC/ABC/FOX/SKY etc..) - So (MAYBE) Fubo has missed the point on cord cutting and targeted streaming, (MAYBE) Fubo knows but wants people to think it's a cable/cord killer service, or (MAYBE) Fubo is an initiative sponsored by a major cable company to rope former customers into a service that, at it's core, is exactly what people are trying to get away from or already paying for.NOTE to Fubo: The point of targeted steaming apps is to allow customers to pay for ONLY the channels they use. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Mhz, MLB,, Netflix, Amazon Prime all do this very well.. So if Fubo REALLY want to impress customers, they will figure out a way to corral all of the network relationships they've made into apps or options within their app that allow customers to purchase focused content like EPL, Europa League, Bundesliga League, specific team matches or cup competitions without the need to channel surf and slog through irrelevant content to find the content they're seeking. Otherwise, there's really no point. The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.",Performance and Stability

When you see the same commercial 50 to 100 times over a couple of hours, your head is ready to explode.3) you like a menu where you have to press a button 20 times or more to find a channel.4) you are a cycling fan and pay extra for Fubo Cycling only to find that it doesn't have a single live event for over 3 months, and repeatedly shows an obscure race in China from last year for the entire 3 months.5) you don't mind an app that crashes repeatedly and has navigation problems that were present several versions ago, fixed, and reappear in subsequent versions.6) you don't mind recording something only to find you have to wait several hours to view it.7) you don't mind being patronized by the 'support' staff.One good thing about FuboTV, it's easy to cancel your subscription.

I am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan and wanted to watch the post season games, but the NHL and stations like NBC will only grant access to the games if customers provide their cable company information. If these stations don't catch on soon, they will get left behind, like newspapers and video rental companies The Internet has changed everything. NBC can either adapt or become irrelevant. More and more people are cutting their cable connections. If NBC wants to have customers, then it needs to grant people access to the games who don't have cable.

The buffering I experience is only with this application. I even purchased a new Fire TV upgrading from a gen 1 Fire Stick thinking it could be the issue but nope. Zero issues when streaming Netflix, HBOGO, Showtime but NBCSN... buffers all the time. Live, replays, you name it, buffering. Other devices I use in the same location are getting 100+ MBPS speeds so buffering shouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the application itself. Streaming from the NBCSN website on my laptop doesn't seem to hiccup so once again must be app related.

Sproink,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance,"I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance. How I came to use this app and my experience is as follows: I recently gave traditional cable the boot and have been using PlayStation VUE for TV service. The most recent NASCAR race was not available on the NBCSN channel but was available through this app. I was curious how well this app would work for a live sporting event and decided to give it a shot. I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine. I was excited to give this application a try, but don't see it as a viable option for watching live content at this point.

Was trying to use this to watch the Olympics, but the interface is really not good; a lot of events are labeled as ""live,"" but then when you click on them you get a ""slate"" (TV jargon) about the event being over; every item you can select starts with a commercial, and then you watch the commercial and end up with a finished event or, often enough, video playback issues that require you to restart it (getting the commercial again) and then getting another fail.  Then there's the titles they were choose.... instead of X vs Y in SPORT as the title, they'd spoil it by saying X defeats Y in SPORT.  The only reason to get this app is because you have no other choices.It worked, and it's not terrible.  We watched the olympic opening ceremony last night; the video quality was generally very good, but there were occasional quality drops, and after some time we'd lose the stream entirely, causing us to go back to the home screen and re-select the video feed; it seems to always start off with a commercial - so you're missing content while you re-acquire the stream.This happened after a couple of hours, so I figured if it would stream that long without a glitch, then it's acceptable - but then it started happening more frequently.

It is very sad to watch.I bought my first Kindle (the generation 3) in late 2010 and immediately fell in love with it. I loaded it up with AmazonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s E-books. It was only black and white with limited internet capability but it was a great device. I really liked the chicklet style keyboard. I still have that first kindle today and it is still working. What a fun device!  On the 28th of September 2011, I upgraded to the new Kindle Fire Full Color 7ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ with Multi-touch display and Wi-Fi. This gave me greater connectivity to the internet and the books were slightly easier to read. Finally, in 2013 I ordered the latest Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) which had better contrast and an 8.9ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ screen. Amazon also claimed that it had 15% faster page loads. It has a 167 PPI display and was the lightest Kindle at 5.98 ounces until 2016's Kindle Oasis. This is the one that became my companion. This is the one that is dying at three years old, a mere child. We will get to the culprit who I accuse of committing this slow, painful and tortuous death in just a minute.On the 14th of December this year Amazon sent out an update Fire OS 5.3.2.1. This free software update added the Amazon ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app plus some other general improvements and performance enhancements. Well, since I hadnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t ordered the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app, just before Christmas (22 December 2016), I decided to uninstall the app. My Kindle Fire, which had been operating beautifully in all modes before, now began to display some quirkiness. Just minor annoyances at first: a very slight delay when calling up a book, the battery recharging at a bit slower speed, auto-connect to my Wi-Fi was intermittent, and my Tumblr App was failing to load pictures. Then I made my first mistake (that day). In order to uninstall the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app I went through the normal ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ procedure and found that I could not uninstall or delete the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. I decided I needed a stronger uninstaller and went on the Amazon web site and downloaded an ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. When that didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t work I decided that perhaps I needed a virus checker and malware cleaner. So I went back to the Amazon web site and ordered Malware and Virus Cleaner for Fire devices (OxCleaner) as soon as I ran this one it showed I had several pieces of Malware, Megabytes of trash, and 97 virus errors on my Kindle. For just $4.49 -- it recommended that I down load another app Malware and Virus Cleaner to actually clean up my Kindle. Yet another app Optimizer & Trash Cleaner Tool for Kindle Fire Tablets was also recommended to clean the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtrashÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ as well as the viruses. Like a fool, I bit on this deal and downloaded the $4.49 program. I ran it and within seconds it came back to inform me that everything was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhunky doryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ my Kindle was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood to goÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. Suddenly, I noticed my Kindle battery was draining much faster than usual but besides that everything seemed okay. Just to make sure I performed a 40 second off/on switch reset to give my Kindle a fresh start.Shortly after this I noticed that one of my books did not open and I called an Amazon Customer service representative. Julius D. was extremely helpful and very patient with me and we spent nearly an hour on the phone as he guided me through several attempts to fix my Kindle. The only area he seemed unfamiliar with was what the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was and how to uninstall it. Outside of that he took me through nearly every procedure possible to fix the device except a total factory reset. After that I contacted two other customer representatives who were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how to get rid of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. It was then that my Kindle began to die. In its death throes it constantly threw up black screens; it seemed to take forever to go from one screen to the next and often just went to black screen; the battery would drain in a matter of minutes and recharging took hours; I had to re-download books that had been there before, it began struggling to open a book and my little kindle just went to a white or black screen. (Choke!) In spite of all the problems I began experiencing with other programs, the persistent ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app just stayed where it was and it would open intermittently. I began to conclude that the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was the culprit that was killing my kindle.

This was the first time since I had signed in to Amazon since 1994 that their customer-centric commitment failed. It had failed totally and now my faithful companion, my Kindle, was dying a slow and excruciating death. It had taken the poison pill and there was no antidote.

After contacting the developer multiple times, I realised he just didn't care. I have two other relatives who had the same problem, so I know it isn't just my Kindle. Actually, I have three Kindles, so that's a total of FIVE so far it won't work on. This app is a total loss, renders my Kindle unusable, and the developer is one of the worst I've dealt with on Amazon. He won't even respond to my requests for help anymore. I finally had to uninstall this app and bought ""Ip cam viewer"" (full) and found no problems so far with that one. Take my advice, if you have a Kindle Fire, stay away from this app. I do have to add this, the app does work well on my Nexus 7 tablet, but it does NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE DEVICES. If you have another kind of tablet, it is a hit or miss, try the free version first. Better yet, if you have IP cameras and want to be able to choose from a list of good monitoring apps that work, don't buy a Kindle in the first place. Buy something else that will allow purchases from the Google Playstore. There is a better selection and most likely your device will be compatible with this app. Good luck.",Compatibility and Device Issues

No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

BuyItOnce,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW+ decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them.",Performance and Stability

And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.

I told her what I would like for her to do is the right think and refund me for a service I will not be using for this next month.

The Froggie Family,1.0 out of 5 stars,Atrocious business practice,"An extremely lacking streaming service, buffering even when I have 1gig internet and was running Ethernet from my modem to Chromecast. Canceled my ""trial"" due to the awful interface and having games randomly cut off during the last 8 minutes. In live sports, those are moments you'll never get back and paying 70 a month for garbage like that is tragic. Needless to say Fubo wasn't done with me there. They decided to reactive my account with my permission 3 month later and just start billing me a fluctuating price form 65-75 a month. Sadly it took me 5 month to notice due to a high tempo life in the military. Once I reached out and asked for an explanation their original response was pretty much. ""well our system created a second account and it's been over 24 hours so we can cancel now and you'll have it until the end of the month"" - mind you, I've been traveling and out of a house for 4 months and haven't even turned a TV or tried to stream any sports the entire time, and if I ever wanted to, I would have given my money to anyone other then FUBOTV.

After 8 days, I received a response from LaKeitha that offers zero resolution and is accusatory about the cause of the problem. I have only used this service to call and text, no strange attachments or seedy material. I can't imagine what my usage crime would've been, but LaKeitha apparently doesn't either nor does she care. So, now all of my business contacts are contacting me at a number that is no longer valid and I have no idea what communications I am missing. Here is her response ""Our security system is equipped with automation that flags accounts that are violating our Terms & Conditions.Because it is automatic, we cannot see the reason for the block, nor are we able to determine if and when the account(s) will be available for use again in the future.

I finally had to uninstall this app and bought ""Ip cam viewer"" (full) and found no problems so far with that one. Take my advice, if you have a Kindle Fire, stay away from this app. I do have to add this, the app does work well on my Nexus 7 tablet, but it does NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE DEVICES. If you have another kind of tablet, it is a hit or miss, try the free version first. Better yet, if you have IP cameras and want to be able to choose from a list of good monitoring apps that work, don't buy a Kindle in the first place. Buy something else that will allow purchases from the Google Playstore.

No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

It worked for two days, then a two second power outage reset something and I can't pull up feed on my phone anymore.

BuyItOnce,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW+ decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them.",Functionality and Features

It is very sad to watch.I bought my first Kindle (the generation 3) in late 2010 and immediately fell in love with it. I loaded it up with AmazonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s E-books. It was only black and white with limited internet capability but it was a great device. I really liked the chicklet style keyboard. I still have that first kindle today and it is still working. What a fun device!  On the 28th of September 2011, I upgraded to the new Kindle Fire Full Color 7ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ with Multi-touch display and Wi-Fi. This gave me greater connectivity to the internet and the books were slightly easier to read. Finally, in 2013 I ordered the latest Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) which had better contrast and an 8.9ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ screen. Amazon also claimed that it had 15% faster page loads. It has a 167 PPI display and was the lightest Kindle at 5.98 ounces until 2016's Kindle Oasis. This is the one that became my companion. This is the one that is dying at three years old, a mere child. We will get to the culprit who I accuse of committing this slow, painful and tortuous death in just a minute.On the 14th of December this year Amazon sent out an update Fire OS 5.3.2.1. This free software update added the Amazon ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app plus some other general improvements and performance enhancements. Well, since I hadnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t ordered the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app, just before Christmas (22 December 2016), I decided to uninstall the app. My Kindle Fire, which had been operating beautifully in all modes before, now began to display some quirkiness. Just minor annoyances at first: a very slight delay when calling up a book, the battery recharging at a bit slower speed, auto-connect to my Wi-Fi was intermittent, and my Tumblr App was failing to load pictures. Then I made my first mistake (that day). In order to uninstall the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app I went through the normal ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ procedure and found that I could not uninstall or delete the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. I decided I needed a stronger uninstaller and went on the Amazon web site and downloaded an ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. When that didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t work I decided that perhaps I needed a virus checker and malware cleaner. So I went back to the Amazon web site and ordered Malware and Virus Cleaner for Fire devices (OxCleaner) as soon as I ran this one it showed I had several pieces of Malware, Megabytes of trash, and 97 virus errors on my Kindle. For just $4.49 -- it recommended that I down load another app Malware and Virus Cleaner to actually clean up my Kindle. Yet another app Optimizer & Trash Cleaner Tool for Kindle Fire Tablets was also recommended to clean the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtrashÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ as well as the viruses. Like a fool, I bit on this deal and downloaded the $4.49 program. I ran it and within seconds it came back to inform me that everything was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhunky doryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ my Kindle was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood to goÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. Suddenly, I noticed my Kindle battery was draining much faster than usual but besides that everything seemed okay. Just to make sure I performed a 40 second off/on switch reset to give my Kindle a fresh start.Shortly after this I noticed that one of my books did not open and I called an Amazon Customer service representative. Julius D. was extremely helpful and very patient with me and we spent nearly an hour on the phone as he guided me through several attempts to fix my Kindle. The only area he seemed unfamiliar with was what the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was and how to uninstall it. Outside of that he took me through nearly every procedure possible to fix the device except a total factory reset. After that I contacted two other customer representatives who were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how to get rid of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. It was then that my Kindle began to die. In its death throes it constantly threw up black screens; it seemed to take forever to go from one screen to the next and often just went to black screen; the battery would drain in a matter of minutes and recharging took hours; I had to re-download books that had been there before, it began struggling to open a book and my little kindle just went to a white or black screen. (Choke!) In spite of all the problems I began experiencing with other programs, the persistent ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app just stayed where it was and it would open intermittently. I began to conclude that the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was the culprit that was killing my kindle.

This was the first time since I had signed in to Amazon since 1994 that their customer-centric commitment failed. It had failed totally and now my faithful companion, my Kindle, was dying a slow and excruciating death. It had taken the poison pill and there was no antidote.

I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine.

The only reason to get this app is because you have no other choices.It worked, and it's not terrible.  We watched the olympic opening ceremony last night; the video quality was generally very good, but there were occasional quality drops, and after some time we'd lose the stream entirely, causing us to go back to the home screen and re-select the video feed; it seems to always start off with a commercial - so you're missing content while you re-acquire the stream.This happened after a couple of hours, so I figured if it would stream that long without a glitch, then it's acceptable - but then it started happening more frequently.  After the third time we switched to another TV that had the cable box on it and just watched the rest uninterrupted.I'd give it one star if I were rating the coverage, though!",User Interface and UX

I had this situation once before with Hulu, and they quickly refunded me and I subscribed again once I could afford the payments (yay Hulu!).  They earned a customer for life by doing that.  I think Fubo could learn from that example, honestly.Recommendation: Sling TV offers a better bang for your buck (that's the service I decided to go with since it's less expensive and offers the channels I want).  I had considered going back to Fubo in October, but now it's for sure no.",Customer Support and Responsiveness
jimbaround02,2.0 out of 5 stars,Frequent channel buffering and pixelated video,"I was pretty excited when I first tried Fubo TV.  They have a wide selection of channels including the local sports channels I no longer have with my limited cable lineup.  Unfortunately, during my free trial period I experienced a lot of problems with the video being pixelated.  I thought it was just one channel, so I switched to the Weather Channel.  It worked well for a while, but then began to do the same thing.  This issue occurred while at my vacation house.  When I got home I installed the app on my Amazon TV.  There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.  This some times only occurs for a few seconds and other times I have to close and re-open the app.  It's too bad this channel doesn't appear ready for Prime Time.  I was looking forward to consolidating my video on Fubo and getting rid of Hulu and Sling.  Looks like at the end of the month I'll be getting rid of Fubo.",Performance and Stability
michael w,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible app and service,"Terrible app and service.  The only one I have ever experienced that was worse was SlingTV.  Both buffer constantly, freeze, and require reboots often.  I ordered this to watch NBC Sports Network so I was seeing all the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Don't count on watching your favorite competition without lots of interruptions.  I literally couldn't watch a single Luge run (all under one minute runs) without it buffering at least once if not more often.That's truly pathetic.  We have a stable and speedy connection and have no issues with amazon prime, netflix, youtube, and a myriad of other streaming types of content.If you're looking for a streaming service app, this one is a real drag.

James Altemus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Random commercials on certain channels are a feature, not a bug","We switched to fuboTV from another streaming service because the other service dropped a key channel for us. The service works well enough, though for a live sports-focused streaming service, the lack of anything ESPN and the lack of alternate/back channel functionality on the remote are curious choices, but something we've adapted to.What really bothers me about fuboTV is their ad delivery. fuboTV has figured out a way to insert ad breaks into live events like soccer, which are generally broadcast without commercial interruption. My issue is that they are using this technology on channels that run pre-recorded programming that already includes commercial breaks. For example, when my kids are watching a show Cartoon Network or Nick/Nick Jr., in the middle of a show segment an block of one or two ads for products not targeted to children (Geico, Red Lobster, etc.) will pop up. The show returns when the ads are complete, but since the technology doesn't pause the underlying program, part of it is lost. Keep in mind that this is in addition to the pre-set commercial breaks in the programs where they will sometime insert local or regional spots over the national spots. I've contacted fuboTV about this issue on a couple of occasions, and while they seem responsive and it does stop for a while, eventually it starts up again. At this point I'm convinced that this is by design.Fix these things and I'll stick with fuboTV. Otherwise, I'm waiting for YouTube TV to be available on FireTV so I can switch.",Functionality and Features
Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible interface. UI created for 1980 cable TV,"I have been testing the various streaming services and the fubotv has the channels I want for the BPL, HOWEVER, and its a big HOWEVER, the interface is utterly horrible on the amazon fire tv. I dont get it ! The slingTV is great, DirecTV is great, Hulu Live is OK. If you are listening Fubo, you need to look at how others setup their UI. Yours is so poor, I will probably not continue past the trial. There is no realtime guide onscreen during a broadcast, you hit the back button you go to a guide at the first listed channel, so you have to scroll down again and again. It buffers but no more than Direct TV and Hulu (Sling did not). I would love to use fubo but the interface was written by someone who obviously does not use it.I would rather pay more for a UI that you can navigate than this. It looks like a third grader wrote the Fire TV interface. You can not change channels without going back. When you go back it defaults to the first channel in the list. It is beyond annoying.

Also, sometimes the programming has some last minute change, and their system simply cancels (And keeps the announcement in in the DVR list, even if i want to erase the notice), instead of figuring out what the change was and adapt the request...

Bob Emmerich,2.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst functioning Fire Tv Stick apps,"I'm doing a free 7 day trial of FuboTV on the Amazon Fire Stick I've had for about a year now. I've tried a lot of streaming apps but this one just won't stream without difficulties.  My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now.

Nathaniel,2.0 out of 5 stars,All the Sports - Time Blocks May End Your Viewing,"Absolutely every sport you can imagine is on Fubo. No exceptions. Even the most obscure sports were available. Ultimately, we discontinued use of FuboTV for one reason. Each game or event has a specific amount of time. Until the program starts, you can't select it. When the time ends, REGARDLESS of whether your sporting event is finished, the stream stops. Period. No saved recording, no continued watching, it's just done.We switched to YouTubeTV and found we had none of the same issues. Sport options are severely diminished, but if you're looking for something that will stream all major football games, YouTubeTV is the way to go.If you're into Soccer/Cycling/F1 Racing/etc, Fubo is way better for you, but may result in missing the last parts of a game.",Functionality and Features

Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.  But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.  Who designed this thing?  It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.  What?  Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.  Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.  Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.

There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.  (Yes, drain is the right term.)  I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes.

On Fubo, you press the menu button and you can change the video resolution, worthless. They really need to work on navigation for users with Fire TV. About the only thing that you get for live TV are select, the arrow buttons, and return. I assume the Roku is much better, not going to pay $100 to find out, though. The only plus is that the local stations seem to work well. Not the stuttering that I see on Playstation Vue local channel, or all the myriad of problems with the local stations on Hulu with Live TV. But the navigation with Fire TV is so bad, I can't use it.What I'd really like to do is rearrange the guide to put all the sports channels together at the bottom of the guide, instead of having some at the top, and another group at the bottom.

This review is for the new version of Fit that came out in fall 2018, in conjunction with the big update to WearOS. I tried using it with my Nexus 6P for simple tracking of the distance and time of my running routes. For this most basic use case, it just doesn't work, which is inexcusable. Hence the 1-star review.  2 critical pieces of functionality are ridiculously broken. First, when you're doing the activity (running, in my case) it usually computes your pace wrong. Sometimes it seems to include the time when you had paused the app (so the pace shows as way too slow), other times it seems to badly overestimate the distance (so the pace is way too fast). Second, even when the measurement is paused, it counts any distance that you move during the pause as part of the route. So what is the pause feature for?!?  The old version of Fit had a bad UI that encouraged user mistakes around pausing/restart, but besides that it worked at least for basic time+distance measurement. Now it can't do even that.  Other important things are broken as well, if contacted I'll be happy to explain them to a Google QA engineer.",Performance and Stability

I also think that the locked exercises/reflections/etc should work like you very very slowly unlock them maybe once you meet a certain criteria or maybe it would be time based. I just think that the locked ones shouldn't be strictly plus membership, but I get the reasons.",Performance and Stability
Lindsey,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,this app is great! however there are a few things that can be confusing and cause the user to think they have to pay to use the app at all. i have never paid for this app but ive been throughly enjoying it for at least 8 months now. sometimes the pop-ups advertising the premium service can be a little invasive and im not completely sure how to feel about the battle pass-esque system (for lack of better phrasing). its not that bad since the items can be available in the store besides the pets,User Interface and UX
Jason Burnett,2.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,"Free is best. I had a subscription in the hopes it would let me schedule recurring goals and tasks, it didn't. It's really all the app is missing right now. The subscription does not add enough to make the extra cost worthwhile. Also it was very difficult to unsubscribe, which feels kinda manipulative, to unsubscribe you cannot do it in the app, you have to go to the play store.",Functionality and Features
Luke C,1.0 out of 5 stars,tried using it to watch the Super Bowl and it did not,"Really wonderful app! Unlike most apps, Finch doesn't punish you if you need a few days off from checking in. Easy to manage with a lot of really useful insights into your own patterns of behavior. My only issue is that sadly the last update broke the UI, making the app mostly unusable. The team has been kind enough to add a report button for individuals to save their data, but the team is very small and data corruption takes an undetermined amount of time to fix.",User Interface and UX
Eudaemonic Misfit (Nico),1.0 out of 5 stars,Two Stars,I absolutely love this app! All the features are wonderful! Thr onoy thing I would change would be the format of when you edit goals. I noticed that when you try to delete some goals and press the okay button. It doesnt actually get rid of those deleted goals after you log out and log back in. It doesnt save the changes. Thats really about it that I have seen that I keep getting irritated by but thats really it,Functionality and Features
Sarah A,1.0 out of 5 stars,I really can not give an honest review because I ...,"I enjoy all the opportunities to journal and I am motivated by the cute little finch. I like that it has light excercises and breathing tools. A cute feature is being able to dress up the finch. So, normally I like sound mixes to meditate to or otherwise relax but I think that maybe half of them are rather creepy. The owls and wolves....um, no. I think that they have a good platform but the sounds need tweaking. Less grainy sounding and more soothing sounds needed. Otherwise a great app!",Functionality and Features
N J,1.0 out of 5 stars,Streaming quality very low,seems like it will be beneficial. biggest issue i have is that i need content to be offline as I'm frequently out of service range. i understand it would be unfeasible to install all featured content onto people's phones. but maybe offer the ability to locally save favorite exercises so that they're still available even when offline. it would be really appreciated to be able to stop and do a quick stretch or soundscape when i needed to regardless of my connectivity.,Functionality and Features
Lea Arroyo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work on Fire Stick. Freezes all the time.,"It's a pretty good app. I don't like how so many things are locked behind a paywall, though. This app helps me set goals for the day and suggests things to do such as spending time with family or taking time for myself. It has breathing exercises (though many you have to pay for) and quizzes relating to mental health. One suggestion is that I wish it had a to-do list feature, which would have you make a to-do list and remind you of your things to do. Overall it's pretty good.",Functionality and Features
J H,1.0 out of 5 stars,One Star,I really like this app and it's gotten even better since I started using it. The newest added feature that condenses time assigned tasks was a great thing for someone like me that can have 100 goals in any given day. One thing I wish they would add as an option is to choose if we want the progress reports throughout the week or if we want them combined and only delivered once or twice a week. I would love being able to have the option for one or two reports with all the info.,Functionality and Features
Kiana Komatsu,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't get excited, there's no free access here.","App is helpful for giving the little push need and accpuntability without nagging you. There are somthings I think changing that would be good. The subscription section through the app is not interactable, I would like to know if there are more $ plans avalible through the app and when my next payment is needed. The play store allows it a bit, but even on the website how much we pay is not clear enough. The text size when editing ""reflections"" is a bit small and hard to interact with as well.",User Interface and UX
Mossy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont bother waste of time,"Overall I've been using this for three weeks now, I got a real kick out of the first few weeks. Genuinely some very helpful ideas on here- breathing exercises, good incentive to complete goals without feeling overbearing, and a good atmosphere. However, there is a LOT locked behind a paywall, and the app felt incomplete until I got a free month subscription. The app is also extremely laggy and glitchy and you can't access soundscapes or stretches offline. Still worth a spin imo!",Performance and Stability

Sunny Neon Raye,2.0 out of 5 stars,Need to buy the upgrade software in order to get the most out it and that doe not say much,"the activities are helpful for mindfulness, without being too distracting or demanding. you aren't pestered or penalized for missing a check in. you can even add people to your ""neighborhood"" without them adding the app, and Finch will give suggestions to reach out to those freinds. great for anxiety and adhd. the logic of how the app parses out your reflections is pretty solid; it's impressive! UI design is a little busy, and if my buddy is visiting the forest I can't seem to go back home.",Functionality and Features
Liliana Saeteurn,2.0 out of 5 stars,DRAGS!,"This app is good but most of the features cost a subscription which as a high school student causes me more stress. Two thing that I don't personally like is the fact that there is only one exercise for day and another for night. the other thing that I don't like is that it involves a lot of typing and in your journal the ai says what mood it gives off or something, basically I'd like it for the user to edit what it meant for the user. Overall good app.",Functionality and Features
Elizabeth Freeze,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sub-par mirroring app,I'm really enjoying this app. The motivational quotes each day seem to be just what I need to hear. I love that there's a first aid kit for if you're in a mental emergency. The breathing exercises are great. I wish there was a way to earn more of the rainbow stones since all the clothes and such are so expensive. Also the tree friend feature would be nice if you had a better way to search for friends.

I have the paid subscription and it's definitely worth it for the extra features. However, I find it really frustrating that the amount of gems you get varies so much between exercises, activities, from your Finch at the end of their trip, and even in your daily reward box. I can't figure out why answering my Sammy's questions gives x amount of stones one day but then y amount the next day. It adds a lot of unnecessary stress as I try to figure out the ""right"" answer.",Functionality and Features
Kate,2.0 out of 5 stars,Had to remove once downloaded as it is not a free APP as I requested,Really great app. But there are SO many features and icons that it becomes difficult to navigate.

Robert Barlow,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great app - the mirroring doesn't work well,"Firstly, this app is amazing, I was a bit skeptical at first like others, but the care taking nature of the app draws you in.

I'm not sure if that's a paid feature but it would be a nice option. I'd like to see all my entrys I've made and the associated prompts too.

What used to take me forever can now be done in like 10-20 mins and is simple.

I love the meal plan aspect I really enjoy all the workouts (there's even dance workouts) the 'add food' tab is a bit limited but overall I'm really loving the app now. I might renew.,Functionality and Features
Susan Moore,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"So far, so good. Only 4 stars because there is no verbal guidance during the exercises. Leads to guesswork. If that changes, or if the feature is easier to find, will gladly rethink to upgrade to the 5 stars. Also: Hard sell on the fitness bands. Only app requiring location to log workputs on amazon fit. Please change that. Costly enough- $210 / year. Yet, still selling new features and challenges by the month -that adds up. Better marketing strategy, and I would buy!",Functionality and Features
Tiffany Thomsen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of time,Nice for accountability though there are some issues. Exercises/workout are just challenging enough and paced well. I find the calorie tracker definately needs improvement. Everything is listed in ounces and I don't measure much of the food I eat that way. I use cups and tablespoons much more frequently. When you scan the barcode it is always messed up for serving size and calories associated. I have been using another calorie tracking app and just loading for total calories manually.,Functionality and Features

amazon user ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the effort,"I love the water tracking because unlike other apps it allows you to choose different ounces without changing the settings. The exercise routine is amazing and you can see an illustration that moves real time. I didnt give it 5 stars because the calorie counting feature does not have a database as extensive as other apps, so you may not find some brands. Also, the steps count is based on your phone. I have a smart watch, the app doesnt allow you to edit the steps and not sure I can link them.",Functionality and Features

What I don't like is requirement to sync your walking activity to Google fit with no option to manually enter your steps if you use another platform.

I'm not interested in purchasing the tracker the app promotes, I already have a fitbit. There's a lot of different programs and features that require additional fees.",Functionality and Features
amazon user ,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't function.,"I really love this app. I love that they tons of vegetarian options in the menu. The meals are delicous. I have gone outside of my comfort zone to try a few of them, and they have all been great. I love that you can add the items to your grocery list and check off items as you purchase them for each recipe. The app could be imporved if there was a way to save the recipes that you liked, that way you could easily go back to them. I also wish there was a way to see all the recipes in the database because there was one I saw that I can't find after I reinstalled the app. I also like the workouts. I feel like they are great, challenging enough to produce results, but not too challenging where I feel too intimidated to try. I did have an issue with the workouts, where I was unable to view the instructions because it would say I was not connected to the internet. This is why I reinstalled the app and lost some of the recipes I saved previously. This also did not fix the issue. I did reach out for support and they did address my concern, however there was no soultion to fix the issue. This is a really great app, but there is some room for improvement. The recipes alone are a reason for me to enjoy the app, not to mention the workouts. I think once these issues are addressed the app would be perfect.",Functionality and Features

If you're slightly late for your studio work-outs due to technical issues or just for joining late due to fast-paced tight schedules at work, beyond 5 minutes, you are prevented from entering, and this I personally feel is wrong. This is a serious issue and needs to be rectified. All users who have booked the session have to be allowed to enter the studio work out sessions irrespective of being late or not. 4. Scheduling a call, is a wonderful system to let your coaches know when your will be free to receive their call, however there are times when the coaches call you directly. I never minded it, however there are other users who felt it to be annoying, as they might be in the middle of a class or some important meeting. I guess, all calls must be mutually agreed upon.

Not being able to access the info when I can sit at my desk and read it is beyond frustrating. Don't get me started on the food tracking - it's generic and I find that I can't track calories accurately, sometimes a couple hundred calories a day because I can't enter in a food that isn't already in the database and have to find something comparable. I get that the focus isn't hyper micro-managing and learning to have a different relationship with food, which is working for me, but the process would be a lot less vague and I feel a lot more effective if some accuracy were lended to the process. It's just weird that these two things, computer access and more accurate food tracking, aren't a priority for Noom. Not entirely sure I will be renewing if some of this isn't addressed in the updates.",Customer Support and Responsiveness

The program is expensive - $10 for the trial, and $185 for one year (as I understand it). I've lost 4 lbs in 4 wks. The app is a little buggy.",User Interface and UX
ED Deadmeato (Ensign Deadmeat),1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Noom is a fantastic weight loss/control service. The purpose of the plan is to teach you the psychology of eating and how to be able to maintain healthy eating after you've left the program. I lost 35 pounds in 3 months.

Another great thing would be a shopping feature where you can pull up the scanner when you're in the grocery store, right now you have to get in as if you're logging a meal, not too big a hassle, but still.",Functionality and Features

B W,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"I've been using the ""free"" version since the beginning of this year and I enjoy it. I was reading another comment where someone said the speakers speak to slowly...I think the speed that they talk in is fine for trying to fall to sleep. Would I see myself paying full price...I can't say because the free options are good but I don't think they are tempting enough for me to make that commitment. I do believe that the free options are nice-your trying to fall asleep/meditate- not active listening",Performance and Stability
Joe Weinmunson,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"EDITED: Calm has done a good job of addressing their technical problems on Android. It can still be slow to respond, but the behavior is more consistent now.

Reggie E,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"It's an awesome app. The only thing that I don't like is that when you just want to listen to waves or fireplace, there some tracks listed as such but they are instrumental tracks. Great app, 100% recommend. Also have to point out that it desperately needs to have a chromecast feature (specifically for the stretching videos).",Functionality and Features
Chett Garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Love the content and the design. My main request would be to be able to create a sleep playlist. So if I started with a story to fall asleep, a sleep song playlist starts on the back end. This way if I wake up in the middle of the night, I can use the music to fall back asleep without having to look at my screen. Voice control of the app through Google assistant or Galaxy or Siri would be nice too. I'm trying to avoid blue light around sleep.",Functionality and Features
amazon user ,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"This app really helped me slow my thoughts at night, and really relax before going to bed. The bedtime stories gave my mind something else to focus on instead of racing thoughts, and I am able to fall asleep better.

It's sad though that it requires one to subscribe to get the full usage out of the app, but I understand that people have to make money.",Performance and Stability
Kat B,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"I use the app for the sleep stories. They REALLY help calm my mind allowing me to go to sleep easier. I'd give the app 5 starts, but it's a memory hog and freezes when doing my mood check-in, in the middle of the night when I have to change stories, very slow to start, and other times. If that could be fixed, I'd like it a lot more. But overall, the app really does help with my sleep and I won't let the slowness stop me from using it for that reason alone.",Performance and Stability
Grace Morris,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"I really only come here for the sleep stories and *some* of the background sounds (which I do enjoy), like a crackling fire or train tracks.

amazon user ,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"I love the interface, and the overall feel of the app. The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5, is because of the price. i believe there are similar, if not better stories narrated on YouTube for free. The convenience of having all the features in one app really shouldn't warrant such a high price, compared to YouTube being free that is. With the exclusive content in mind, it's good for what it is. The stories are nice, and the narration is amazing.",Functionality and Features
amazon user ,1.0 out of 5 stars,,I really enjoy the app. I have just completed an outpatient mental health course and they would offer meditation everyday.

You can set one at a specific time (and only one) but I'd like to get several throughout the day at random times.,Functionality and Features
Lindsey A,1.0 out of 5 stars,,I really love this app. I relax and get to sleep incredibly quick now! The only thing holding back from 5 starts is that there is not a feature to select multiple sleep stories to play in a row (like a playlist).

Even with that though this app is my favorite I've ever bought and I will continue to use it.,Functionality and Features

Alejandro Zurcher,1.0 out of 5 stars,,The app works great. I think the UI could be improved and transitions between screens as well. On top of this there's a consistent crash when I open the app after a few days; It's like the home screen stucks in a loop loading the contents infinitely until a crash happens.

The designers did not take into account that when the text entry field is active, half of the screen is taken up with the keyboard and it covers up all of the options they show you from prior meals.  It also has the same perverse obsession that all of these apps with classifying food intake according to breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

amazon user ,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Not a bad app but not the best. What I really need is to see how many macros I actually have left without having to click on them individually. That would be extremely helpful. I see what they did with displaying them when you click in them but I'd love to he able to open my log and see how much more of each that I need to eat. The database has almost everything in it that you can imagine. I am a premium user because on black Friday it was on sale for $20 for a year. Too cheap to pass on.

Peter Stubler,4,,"I am a 55+ male and used Lose It! to lose 30 lbs in 5 months spanning the holidays. It is very good and easy to use, The paid version integrates my fitness watch. The food database, barcode scanner, and ability to store recipes makes tracking calories easy. With a few enhancements, it could be great! The food database allows the user to enter a food item by only one type of measurement: count (e.g. number of pretzels), volume (e.g. cup, teaspoon), or weight (e.g. grams, ounces). The nutritional information is often provided for at least two of these types. Further, when searching the database, it is unclear which of these entries will be useful for the measurement you have. The other issue is the unfortunate emphasis on ""net calories"", those consumed vs burned. When looking at your personal history, it is difficult to distinguish between a day on which you simply sat around and starved yourself versus a day in which you took a long hike and ate a hearty meal. The latter contributes more to overall health and should be more easily displayed and tracked.

Rui Cardoso,4,,"This is a great app that I highly recommend. At the start of yet another lockdown I decided I wanted to stay fit at home and so I tried this app. I did the 7x4 full body challenge and I love how the workouts there target all major muscle groups, how they get increasingly harder over time, and the ""personal coach"" feature which adjusts them according to your feedback. The results were indeed impressive. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I'm disappointed in the app now that the challenge is over. Working out every single day is not something I can keep up with indefinitely, so coming out of the 7x4 challenge I wanted to start a new routine where I work out 4 days of the week and I wanted it to be a more or less seamless transition from the last workout in the challenge. However, there are no other full body plans available and all the advanced plans have considerably fewer and easier workouts than the ones I had been doing towards the end of the challenge. They also can't be adjusted by your feedback. I subscribed to the premium plan thinking it would unlock a ""personal coach"" feature such as the one available in the challenge, but all it does is get rid of ads, which I'm okay with as they're not annoying (another plus point for the app). If they ever add a permanent full body plan that continuously adapts to your feedback and preferences, basically like the 7x4 challenge but without the commitment of doing it every single day and without a set end date, I will update my rating to 5 stars. I would even be willing to pay a premium subscription for this feature.",Functionality and Features

Below that first exercise were more variants of the same exercise, jumping jacks. There was no prompt to move on to a different type of exercise. I'd still be doing jumping jacks if I hadn't exited the app! So, a good programme, but the way it works, unless I'm missing something, makes me feel I can't keep up from the start.

Jennifer Fongemie,4,,I really love this app. It's been a great tool to have along with the gym. The workouts do seem to be geared more towards people who are already in shape and can do all the moves.

I can even see the detail where I had to walk around a parked car. The distance and time walked are great and a voice tells me when I've walked a mile and how fast I did it. However ..... The lack of any instructions or documentation is maddening. I still haven't been able to activate the step counter. My goal would be 10,000 steps on a walk. But when I finish the walk, the step counter is still zero. Saving a walk is awkward. I don't think I've lost a walk, but it could easily be done. Battery drainage seems to be heavy. That's the price of the beautifully detailed walk maps. I love those maps, so I'll accept that my phone needs to be charged soon after I finish a walk. I would love to be able to use the app as a daily step counter while I'm not walking for exercise. Count my steps around my house and yard, but don't add time to my exercise record. Can that be done? That would be ideal, but without app instructions, I have no idea whether it's even possible. I lost my first days of use of the app. It pauses and resumed my 'walk' while I was walking, thereby making my time/distance stats worthless for those days. Later I found a setting by which I could turn off 'Auto-Pause'. That seemed to be On by default.

Fabiola Mendes,5,,It's not a super complicated app to use. I do think that amazon fit does have a couple of features that are better but overall this syncs with my fitness pal. The app is easy to read and understand. It does freak me out though that it randomly starts giving you stats and if you are walking and have ear buds in it startles you. I recommend this for people who don't want to invest in a fancy fitbit or apple watch.,Customer Support and Responsiveness
Key A'sha Jones,5,,"I like many people have a fitbit, so I used the app to do the tracking of my distance and route. I was always disappointed.

Michael StÃÂ¥hl,,,Training function miscalculate both steps and distance making them 5 times larger. It should at least verify the measurement with the normal step counter. Also it's impossible to access the GPS route after you have saved the training session.

Also it's impossible to access the GPS route after you have saved the training session.

"DuÃÂ¡an",,,"This app is okay since it's not aggressive in asking you to allow this and that and to give your personal data, but as with many other similar apps it also requires mobile data turned on in order to get precise GPS info about how long was your walk (although GPS can work without internet, but not here) and mobile data turned on will affect your battery life (more drainage the longer you walk). Otherwise, without internet, it just sums up the number of your steps and then multiply them with the length of your step and this, in turn, is automatically calculated based on your height (providing you entered it). So, this is pretty inaccurate since your step can vary. It can be shorter when you are tired and drag your feet, and longer when you walk vigorously. I compared this app with Map My Walk.

Mark Bolognini,,,I love the app and I love the reminders to drink water and especially the notifications telling you the equivalent of what you walked or ran. Such as x amount of miles you walked is the equivalent of going from London to Paris...my one issue would be the GPS. A lot of times it's inaccurate and may add or subtract a half a mile give or take. It's not all the time but it's enough to warrant an improvement,Compatibility and Device Issues
Krystal Lily,,,"I adore this app, it is easy to use, easy to understand. I keep coming back even after a few years because of how easy it is and how reliable it has become. The sensors aren't really easy to shake with your hand and actually change per step. Sometimes it needs a minute to load and that's okay. I really enjoy the training section. It let's me have a more active role in my workouts and keeps nice goals. Haven't spotted any disruptive ads yet.",Functionality and Features
Alex L,,,"I don't mind the banner ads, but seemingly randomly very obtrusive full screen ads appear and it's pretty frustrating. I like the app though.

Judy Glover,,,Used this app for years without problems. But a couple annoying changes were made. First of all when I turn it on all the sudden it go to a blue screen where I had to wait while a little bar on the bottom was working. Before my screen just came up. Don't know what the use of that was for. And now they have all these ads that pop up over your information that you can't get rid of without getting out of the app and coming back. Today was worst!

Hoss Monkey,,,"The app is nice & have used it for over 500 miles. Doesn't seem to be very precise in measuring/Calculating distance, even with GPS turned on? Not a fan of the voice ques added recently & wasn't obvious how to turn off. Would be nice to be able continue tracking on same map should one accidentally hit Finish. Needs a mute button in app, as it counts down when starting exercise and has a cheer sound when hitting finish exercise.

It can be a little wonky at times, since I use a different device to listen to music on my walks, (yes I know there's a music mode, but I've been using Pandora for 5 years and have the playlist all set up), I miss the voice telling me what my mile time is. I walk a lot of hills, so I know I am burning more calories than shown but it gives you a good idea how well you're doing. I love the achievements! Nothing like positive reinforcement to keep you going. Just hit 330k steps today, for those from Los Angeles that's up to the top of the Micheltorena stairs and back...lol.

I will have reached the Earth's core soon... no clue what that looks like... then what's my target?? :)),Functionality and Features
Dotz Ã¢â¬Å18cats1pigzÃ¢â¬,,,"Yes it has ads, but I don't find them overly invasive. It does what it's supposed to do. It acts as a passive step counter, & has a training mode where you can log your jaunts. The accuracy of the miles per minute seems to improve as you go along. Also, this app does tell you it's overall accuracy depends on phone hardware. And don't run the app and battery saver at the same time. It really goes screwy.",Functionality and Features
Adrienne Yt 22,,,"I tried another app before this one. I was really intent on recording my steps. I would walk about 5 miles, it would give me credit for 1. It seemed like it would stop tracking whenever my screen went off...THIS one is giving me everything I want, 100 percent. Bug difference. All I wanted was a record of miles, steps and time . Perfect. Very accurate. So happy with this!!",Functionality and Features
Jeff Frank,,,"Very good for tracking miles walked. I use it at work and play...it's easy to use and not a bother. It let's me know when I have reached a goal walking and sets new goals , for me great app............ the review is kinda long wanting 500 words to explain how good it is they need to cut it back like 200 words. Or they can just let you put words in to get past this and go on to ratings and back to your phone. I hope they correct it and make it simpler for us. I tried to think of everything bye",Functionality and Features
Elizabeth,,,"I like the app. It's free, there are barely any ads, and the main functions - counting steps, time, keeping track over months, etc. - work well. But, and I know I'm being picky, their ""London to Paris"" badge distance (and a few others) isn't accurate. They have it set as ""135 miles,"" but 'as the crow flies' it's 214 miles. Aside from that, I like it. Edit: Thanks for your response!!",Functionality and Features
Andria K,,,This is an awesome step tracker. If your just curious how many you walk on a regular basis or if you need a little push to start moving. It really works for everyone. I really enjoy the option to compete with people near you. That definitely gives an edge for wanting to do better. And I really enjoy the drink more water reminder. That's just fun!,Functionality and Features
CLINT MCCLELLAND,,,"Only used for a couple of days but impressed so far. I walked over 3 miles yesterday and confirmed with Google maps the distance and periodically checked the step recording accuracy. I am an engineer that has precisely measured my average stride length and results lined up well and met expectations. The ad experience has been minimal so far with the free version. That said, I typically upgrade to ""ad free"" in most apps if the free version performs well.",Performance and Stability
Chad Sawyer,,,"Easy to navigate. No worries about false steps being counted when you can simply pause and unpause your workout when necessary. The free version contains ads but the ads don't ruin the users experience. By day 2 working with Step Tracker, I was so focused on my goals that I don't remember what the ads were trying to sell. The best part is it only takes a few dollars and those forgettable few adds are gone for good. I give Step Tracker 5 stars without any hesitation. too bad other apps fall",Functionality and Features
Rick G,,,"Exceeds my expectations. I use it to track walks & hikes for time, distance, steps, calories, activity history and achievement of goals. Really like the (optional) voice feedback which provides occasional status reports (time, distance, calories, pace, progress toward goals) via my Bluetooth wireless headphones while listening to music. Paid the one-time $2.99 to get rid of ads and it's worth it. All around great app. Highly recommend.",Performance and Stability
down2two Liketoknow,,,I started walking for my health and this has been really nice it has the GPS function. I can track the mileage from one point and then restart and to another point. It's very nice. Very helpful it also lets you put in your personality data like your weight so it can also do some calorie calculating. It also keeps track of how fast you walk. I highly recommend this app for anybody who's walking for their health.,Functionality and Features
Nickolas McAnally,,,"This app has been great for keeping track of progress, it is encouraging with the badges, and the GPS is better than any other tracking app I've had, and I went through about six others. You also can plan for say a 1 mile walk, but at the end you still wanna keep going? It lets you know your time at 1 mile, but will keep tracking extra progress automatically. It helps to not have to start and stop constantly.",Functionality and Features
Robert Lee Raimondi,,,So far it's been really great. I've been wanting to get a step counter and a fitness device for my wrist but in the meantime I'm using this app and I will probably continue to use it after I get the wrist or wearable device. It seems to be accurate gives you some good metrics and a map of the route that you took. There are some ads but they're not very intrusive and they don't seem to be causing a negative experience,User Interface and UX
Jaroslaw Matraszek,,,"Good app, so far doesn't drain battery and measure your steps all day. I like it. Update from 02102023.

So its time to say goodbye",Functionality and Features
Larry Bogan,,,Super simple and fun! I've only used it once but I like it already! I don't know how accurate it is because my wife wore her Apple watch and it showed 1.5 miles walked whereas mine showed 1.7 mi walked. I like how it praises me at mile markers. I got an attaboy at 1 mi and I got confetti at the end of my walk.,Functionality and Features
Riley Renteria (Stay),,,"I love the app a lot, it's fun to see where I've gone and stuff and the steps are accurate. I like that it reminds you to drink water and sometimes motivates you when you track your walk or run. The only thing is that the water drinking is weird because obviously it has no idea how much you drank but it does give you goals! Overall, 10/10",Functionality and Features
Shari Bradley,,,"This is a great pedometer except for one thing. Obviously is you aren't holding, carrying or having your phone on your person, your steps cannot be counted in those instances. I like it though and it's very accurate while you have your phone. So I will continue using it some. I also wear my sports band when it is charged.",Functionality and Features

The app will tell you how many miles you've gone, number of steps, and estimated calories burned, BUT ONLY on that day (ie at midnight, you can no longer see this info!). After the day is over, you can only see the ""heart points"" and ""movement-""whatevers you have done, and these two ""measurements"" are the only things you can set goals toward. While the idea behind these is okay, I still want a solid number that makes sense to compare and work toward, and it feels unfair to track the info that most fitness apps would track and then hide it/remove it/withhold it. It's nice, I suppose, to get more points for running than walking, and is a different metric than just steps, but the exact ""how"" this works is kindof a mystery. Literally: 1 point for every 30 steps/minute and ""more"" (two?) for ""more effort"". LOTS OF AIR QUOTES! Lots of made up metrics that may or may not make sense for you. As someone who walks a lot as part of my job and to commute, I just want to compare day to day to track what I've done. It doesn't work for me. If you need a reminder to get up and move, this app has nice notifications and a cute graph that i guess you could motivate yourself to do, knowing a run will get the goal met faster than walking, which might be motivating. It will also attempt to split off your runs/walks and show a quick map. So you can see at a glance how long that walk was in the AM vs PM. Of course, this gets truncated/partially deleted after the day is done. It attempts to split my day up into about a dozen separate ""walks"" and appeared to only save (the longest?

I don't understand how Google maps are incredibly accurate when I'm driving but not when I'm walking. I've read the suggestion to reset the app every day and that's not an acceptable solution. The only saving grace is getting heart points which are mildly motivating.,Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Latest update destroyed a previously useful if not perfect app. Inaccurate tracking is expected, but now inability to edit time and distance. All previous runs, walks, hikes are lost. Can't view run details. No synch to fit website. The uplifting cards gone, replaced with an abstract and unmotivating heart points. The old UI design was good, graphics spiffy, but the new design is just lacking, uninspired, even lazy. Worst of all, changed phone and everything is gone again. Never use this app ever again.",User Interface and UX
A Google user,,,"For some reason the app created an erroneous data point on my weight graph. I can click on the entry and edit the value, but this does not seem to change the data point on the graph, nor does it seem to save my new weight entry. I cant believe we cant remove weight data entries, or that the app has this issue to begin with. It ruined the look of my weight progression graph.",Functionality and Features
Leah Biscotti,,,"This app doesn't even work as a pedometer. Connect to GPS or not, steps randomly fluctuate throughout the day. When walking with friends with other devices, I'm sometimes 1,000+ steps less than what their devices record. I've gone to bed with 20k steps displaying, just for it to jump down to 15k overnight. There is no rhyme or reason and no consistency. The GPS also never maps my full workout route. Using a stationary machine does not pick up half the time either.",Functionality and Features
Laura McElhinney,,,"I used to love this app. It connects to so many different apps - it was my central hub. Now it very rarely syncs my steps, so my weightloss app thinks I'm not walking.

I'm about to look into another app that may be able to work better.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Google fit use to be a great app. With the big update earlier this year the app is now useless. I can go on a run using another app and it shows an accurate mileage while fit says I went half the distance. If I look at the map that fit provides it shows a path I did not take. The most frustrating part is the apps are set up to share data and they don't.  Edit: Setting my height and weight is not the solution.  Again I use another tracker when I run and it shows the correct path that I ran, fit shows a very odd path where i cut corner and miss complete parts of my run.  Yesterday I went for a 3.5 mile run and fit showed it as 1.2 miles.",Functionality and Features
Cynthia Chou,,,"I really wanted to use this app to store all my health information. However it is not very friendly in regards to the menstrual tracking portions. At the moment, it does not allow updates to existing menstrual entries. The only way information can be modified is by deleting all data completely! However that doesn't even solve all the problems, because once data is deleted, syncing between devices fails even when turned on in the settings. An issue only targetting women. I'm really disappointed.",Functionality and Features
Scott Dickinson,,,3-12-2021. And you broke the app again. It's sees the heart points but the gauge shows 0. Please fix Pros: Easy to use and able to track a wide variety of activities. Cons: The notes section for each activity needs to be increased in size. I'm trying to use it to track additional information and I run out of room after 100 characters or so. Edit Feb 3 2020. For some reason the app is failing to record data like it did before the last update. Please fix this!,Functionality and Features

Elliander Eldridge,,,"This app has a major problem: There is absolutely no way to correct a typo. If you enter a bad data point for a body measurement you can enter a new value afterwards, but the old value will remain in history permanently. If you make the new data value for the same date and time it will show that as your current measurement, but it won't record it in history at all. The only way to fix a typo is to delete all history for that measurement, which is a bit like if Google made us delete entire documents to fix a typo on Google Sheets. You'd then have to go in and enter all the data points again manually for the entire history and hope you don't get another typo. If you need to clear the data again you will first have to clear data for the app in Android settings. If that's not bad enough you can't access the data from a web browser to save it so you will need to keep your data history recorded somewhere else to fix errors if and when they occur. A data entry app that doesn't let users fix typos is of limited usefulness. There's no way to report bugs and Google One support can only read you what is on a single help page which isn't much. Oh, and there's also no way to accurately record BMI. That requires a whole number, but my Doctor's office records to two decimal places. And for tracking steps, I counted my steps while holding the device and it did not record them properly. That said, if you don't care about storing accurate data, the app is great! Nice user interface. Although personally I'd prefer functionality over look and feel.",Functionality and Features

For some people it's started to work again, but obviously not for others.  Very annoying.

Gannon Mendez,,,Update ** - Got the s22 Ultra and installed this app again to see how it works. This time it completely misses the accuracy of my walks. It shows me walking through homes instead of on the streets on my 2 mile walk. Plus I can't turn off my walk until hours after I'm done. Why can't this be updated to work??? It doesn't track my walking accurately. It is consistently off everyday on my steps and on the map. Love the app but since the last update I've had this issue.

However, when I'm actually done I will go to stop and the pause/stop isn't available; it's on the main Journal page. I go do other things and the next day (or later) I open the app and there's the pause/stop view; the activity journal is still going and it says I've been walking for 16+ hours!! I moved to another state recently and the activity monitor appeared when I re-opened the app after several weeks. The activity was running (pause/stop options) and said I did a ""lunch hike"" for 41 miles and 113,500 steps over a period of over three weeks; from the middle of one month into the early part of the next month.

Also, when I ride a bike and have my phone with me, it says it gets the GPS from my phone, but it doesn't record the distance, or anything, just the time.

And then other times when I've walked, it thinks I haven't moved. And unlike the previous version, I can't go into the activity and edit it to the correct distance walked and time it took.

There's a lot that could be improved however - I have lots of trouble importing info from my other tracking apps into Fit. I use a smart scale that also measures muscle mass, body fat, etc and it would be great to be able to add all that info to Google Fit as well.

I love Walking but I'm not going to go just because some app tells me too. Sorry. Also it snows 9 months out of the year where I am so I can't possibly walk every day because it simply isn't safe sometimes to walk in blizzards and 4 + feet of snow. I will give this app one month after I can connect it with go. If my impressions haven't improved by then and/or I find it useless in some way it's going bye bye again. Just so you know I love walking and use a simple app called pedometer pretty regularly. It's a wonderful app that tracks steps taken, distance walked, and calories burned among other things pretty accurately. It isn't very robust but it does exactly what I want and need it to and it does it well. Only downside is I have to turn it on and leave it active for about 5 mins for it to be accurate but it's easy on my phone for battery and processor so with Pokemon go it's amazing even if I can't sync the two.

I liked being able to display the 4 things of interest to me during a run or bike ride. Pace, Heart Rate, Distance and Duration. With the new update as of 11/21 it's not possible to see all 4 at a glance any longer. You have to swipe between screens or tap multiple times to get all 4. Not convenient at all when wearing gloves or in locked mode. I still like the heart rate monitor, but the app no longer provides what I need. I rounded the rating up. I think it's really about a 2.5 start app with the latest modifications. I would have put it between 4 and 5 before.",Functionality and Features

Also while working I don't have my phone on my person so I'm not calculating those steps to help reach my goal. It's discouraging not to see both goals completed. I'd prefer to have move minutes as a goal.,Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,I was a loyal google fit user for 5 years and I used everything the app does. After the change I wanted to give the move minutes and heart points a chance but they didn't work for me due to innacuracy and the fact that I care about step count more. Currently I moving on to another app but it would be perfect if you could have an option to choose steps OR move minutes as your goal.,Functionality and Features

A Google user,,,"I struggled with a serious problem since Mar 19th, with my sessions not able to acquire GPS from the phone. Finally, today, I found that I needed to enable the Settings/Connectivity/Bluetooth ""Play phone voice call on watch"" option on my watch, and also select ""Connect Carlyle HR"" in the Wear OS app on my phone to assure that the Bluetooth connection is fully functional, and that Fit is again able to acquire GPS from the phone, and properly report the routing, heart rate and distance travelled during my sessions.

A Google user,,,"Updated Review (8/20/19 ****) The issue went away some time after I posted the Original Review below! I am not sure what Google or Fossil or both did to fix the issue. I hope it does not occur again and if it does, it would be great to get some notice of the issue being worked on in Fossil and/or Fit support pages.   With respect to the primary functionality, I am quite happy with the app.   Original Review (8/19/2019 *) On my Fossil Gen 5 watch, the app fails to connect to the backend and hence does not track anything. There is the spinning wheel at the top showing the failing attempts to establish the connection. On my Pixel 2, Wear OS app shows the watch is connected through BT to the  phone. The Fit app in the phone shows an X in the Journal tab watch icon for sync.   Hugely disappointed, since I got the watch for the heart rate tracking in Google Fit. Everything worked for about a week and then the phone and the watch stopped syncing, even though the app in both devices seemed to be working independently. I performed a factory reset of the watch and since then, the watch app has been failing to connect to the backend.   Google, is there any hope for a fix?",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"It's a good app. The notifications can get a little tiring but not too bad and I think you can turn them off. To be entirely honest; I only use it for the step tracker and I only check it every few days. I would be alot happier with it, if it was easier to get to my step history. If I could just tap on the part where it shows how many steps I've taken today and then it just shows me a week summary, showing me how many steps I took each day for the week and maybe be able to tap on each day for more details; I'd like that. Thanks for reading.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"I LOVE Google Fit.  I think the main thing I like about it is that it automatically tracks steps.  Additionally, I have mine linked to my Walgreens account & get Walgreens rewards after so many points, & as stated earlier, even if I don't specifically exercise, such as using elliptical, it still tracks steps automatically & those go towards points for Walgreens rewards.  I like that I can track my weight, blood pressure, activities, etc.  I took off one star because up until recently I never had a problem with it not tracking my steps.Then it seemed to just quit working as far as the steps go.I sent feedback on 2 separate occasions regarding this. After the 1st time I sent feedback, some time later it started working again then quit (By the way, I checked to make sure my 'Track activity metrics' in the Settings was on & it was).    Through trial & error, I have discovered that if I turn the Track activity metrics off, & then on again, it starts working after that.I don't know if it gets messed up maybe after having to turn my phone off to charge it, but I will try to notice if I can figure out when it stops working.I am happy I figured out a solution, but it's still kind of a pain.",Functionality and Features

Good product, glad I downloaded.",Functionality and Features
gamer749,,,"An excellent app when paired with a Fossil Smart Watch. The watch contains a pulse sensor that continuously monitors your heart rate and the app uses this to help determine calories burn and heart point calculation. Even when you take a break in a workout, as long as your heart is beating fast, you will still burn calories and earn heart points while you cool down. Data is shared with linked apps such as MyFitnessPal and Sleep Cycle to provide a full health profile. Google Fit tracks it all in the journal as well. The smart watch also lets me start, pause and finish the workout without having to pull out the phone. The data migrates to the phone once the workout is complete, though it may take a minute or two over the bluetooth connection. Use this with any smart watch, especially if the watch has the Wear OS operating system. Fitness bands are also compatible, just make sure it can monitor your pulse for more accurate data.",User Interface and UX

James Forbes,,,Just got the app today and I'm deleting it. I tried to remove food items I added from the list so I could choose another one that was more accurate as far as the amount of calories.

This was my goto app for diet/exercise tracking. Now it's just a cash grab.,Performance and Stability
Alex E,,,"I was hyped up about this app from YT, and my very first experience with it is that it's super glitchy to the point that it's nearly unusable or even flat out unusable.

Zak Edwards,,,1. Everything is behind a pay wall. I mean hey make a good product and ask people to pay. But pretty much the whole app is a pay to really use. Just make it a one time payment of x dollars. Then you can have a subscription for the more personalized options. But to do anything you have to pay 80 a year or 20 a month.

Alexandra Amato,,,"MFP is solid enough. It does a pretty good job of being a calorie counter. In recent years though, I feel like the scanner has gotten worse, it is hit or miss even though once I enter the product manually it shows up. The price of premium is what ultimately drove me away.

I didnt expect to see many vegan options in the food data base , which I'm used to although it would be nice to see more of. I was definitely disappointed with the lack of exercises available to click on in the database of movements. Squat cleans is definitely not a new or foreign exercise . It's more work than it's worth to create a new exercise for every single daily entry . The biggest disappointment was the app not being able to account for calories burned in strength training.

With it, I was able to lose about 35 lbs in about six months, simply through rigorous tracking. I take a star off for two reasons. The first is for some bugs, including not being able to get input from my pedometer app (which is claimed to be supported and worked initially, but ceased and cannot be reestablished). The second reason is the incessant marketing. Near daily advertising for UA products gets a bit annoying. I might be more receptive if it wasn't so frequent.

Andrew Berger,,,"I've been using the Premium version of the app for 4 weeks now and overall I'm satisfied. User friendly, great food database, easy method for logging caloric intake, tracking nutrition, creating recipes.

Con is that adding hime-cooked food is difficult. I end up adding individual ingredients. Also, I do not use the fitness tracker integration. Can't speak to that.",Functionality and Features
Zombalaya Q,,,I love this app! It makes it so easy to track calories and other nutritional stats throughout the day. Food items are easy to find and input as well! My only issue is that I wish it would allow you to make new recipes from already created ones. Some recipes only have a few ingredient changes and it's bothersome to have to input all those ingredients all over again. I also don't like that you can't shift whole meals throughout the day. You have to move them single entry by entry.,Functionality and Features
Jonah Rabinowitz-Buchanan,,,"Free version is a useful app for tracking food. I cant speak to the paid version, but I imagine its helpful as well.

Unbelievably annoying, and in no way convinced me that I should upgrade.",User Interface and UX
A Google user,,,"Overall it's a good experience and I've been using it for several years. The fitness tracking is pretty limited though. And there's a big push for upsell even though there are lots of ads. Food database is pretty good for calorie counts, but very inaccurate for other nutrients. It also has a streak that's based on logins, not meals logged, so you have to log on every. single. day, even when traveling or busy. I have nothing better to recommend, but it doesn't delight the way my 5 star apps do.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Great app for tracking calories, both intake and calories burned. I love that you can scan bar codes on food packaging to instantly add the nutritional information. I wish it would sync with more 3rd party fitness trackers. I have a Letscom fitness tracker and this app wont sync with it. It's not communicating fully with my Samsung fitness app either.

However, I cannot see any way to provide diet modifications that would alter one's personal requirements in the macros and nutrient analysis, e.g. low fat, low cholesterol, etc. If this is a function available in the Premium version, they don't say. There are limited exercise options when entering activity. The app appears geared toward fitness buffs and athletes, and seems to ignore other demographics. Most of the recipes on the home page are high in fat, which renders them useless to me. However, this app does a very good job in keeping track of calories and nutrients, and after 2 weeks, I have lost 8 pounds. Not bad.",Functionality and Features

For me the premium isn't necessary, although I can see why some would like it all.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,Works but has bugs. The calorie tracker has helped me lose 7lbs so far! They need to fix some bugs in the free app though. You can create and save meals so its easier to track the next time you eat it. You can also take a picture of the meals.

Such obvious bugs in a free app makes me very hesitant to ever try the paid version.,Performance and Stability
Nayeli Brown,,,"I have lost weight while using this app to track my calorie intake. There is a wide selection of foods and there is a barcode scanner as well. I wish there were more fitness apps that were compatible with this app for tracking purposes. I also would have liked it to be a bit easier to create your own work out. Perhaps some gifs of what the work out should look like , for input clarity. Overall a good app. I have had it for over two years.",Functionality and Features

Riley Perry,,,"Just figured out how to make my own meals on the app to avoid adding each ingredient individually. The app isn't the easiest to use but it works. The servings are a pain to adjust as it leaves out grams or ounces are certain things and doesn't give you the option to add a ratio connecting the two. Also, the label reader darkens my camera and can only be used in very bright lighting.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"I'd very mich like to open the ap to the diary page fist and not the media (articles/receipes/links) page, at least make it an option for the paid app. otherwise, it's pretty good. I'd also really enjoy an ergonomics focused redesign for all the great data, but they still have great graphs and charts to help you quickly understand nutrients for weekly or daily review, it just needs more intuitive data layout and packaging",Functionality and Features
Sasha Shame,,,"Overall I love this app, and it has been extremely valuable and helping me to maintain my health goals. Like many others here, I feel that removing the barcode scanner as a clear money grab is an unwise business move. Considering that the free version has ads, I think the amount of money gained from premium memberships will not be worth it overall versus the loss of ad revenue that is generated from the free version once people drop the app due to not being able to use the barcode scanner.",Functionality and Features
Jodi Edger,,,"Used this app for years and was very successful in losing weight with being conscious of how many calories I was taking in. But it has started glitching.

The weirdest bug is being able to scan a food barcode but not able to add it or keep it added to the day.",Functionality and Features
Desiree Tudder,,,I've used MFP before and didn't care for it. I gave it another shot (years later) and so far I'm enjoying it. It helps that I have a better understanding of healthy food choices (before I had done ww successfully for almost a year when the plan changed and was no longer working for me. Without the points system I was lost. I didn't understand what made certain foods better than others on the point system). Having at least some kind of nutritional plan helps. App is easy to use once used to it.,Performance and Stability
Brad Giessing,,,"One of the best trackers out there, also one of the most buggiest. Once I connect my step tracker, I have to disconnect it and add it daily for it to continue working. Things randomly disappear and appear. I add 20 oz of water that I drink, it never shows up. I go in at it again and never shows up. I add a third time and there's 60 oz. Same thing with food. I will add something for dinner, and suddenly there's two of them. Then they disappear. And then a few minutes later they're back. Buggy.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"Quick, easy, user friendly. Some of the food information is out of date, or not in the system meaning I have to manually enter it all. It's inconvenient that after I enter it all, it still doesn't link it to the barcode. Also, it'd be really nice to enter all the ingredients once, and group them, so from then on all I have to type in is ""egg salad"" or something like that for dishes we regularly eat, the exact same way.",Performance and Stability
Catherine Kirk Horvath,,,"Edit: amazing service! I left a review, and had a response within 24 hours. If only other app developers were so responsive.

Vic,,,"Overall, this is an excellent app. One annoying bug: If I enter an exercise and then edit it, instead of an actual edit, it creates a new entry, so there is then two entries. Example: I do cardiovascular exercise. I input 20 minutes and 220 calories. I end up working out a bit more, so I edit it, changing it to 26 minutes and 250 calories. The bug: It will then show two entries: 20 minutes w/ 220 calories, and 26 minutes w/ 250 calories.",Functionality and Features
John W,,,"It takes a minute to get the hang of this app, and it's far from perfect. Looking up foods is annoying. The serving sizes take some mental math.

Only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars- can' t delete a mistaken entry in food diary (or I've not been able to figure out how!).

Martin Barrell,,,Good for tracking calories and checking nutrients. Would be far better if there were not so many apparently duplicate entries for foods (many of which are inaccurate) and a better way of searching.

I believe they will give you 30 day free trial of premium to try it. If it were $5 month I would probably try it and if I liked it switch to yearly but $10 month equates to $120 yearly and I can not justify it when so many apps cost less.

A Google user,,,"Tracking calories is a smart way to weight loss and eating well! I have lost 15 pounds since I began tracking my meals on this app! It is easy to use and the ability to scan the barcodes of the foods I have consumed makes tracking calories convenient. It is difficult to track the calories of my homemade meals, therefore I frequently am estimating calories for them. Overall, I highly recommend this app for weight loss and good health.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"I've used this free app many times(without purchasing anything extra) over the years and it's always helped me get closer to my weight goals. There's a community of people and alot of extra help and motivators that come along with this app too. It has just about any restaraunt menu or grocery item you'd think of, so that's always nice. You don't have to figure out calories or nutrition info, it's just there! I've recommended it multiple times and my friends/family have also had success and enjoyed it. Definitely would recommend to people who are starting a diet and need a push or accountability and need help keeping track of their intake. Anyone really. It's a great application.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"Had app for 2 weeks, which is usualky OK time to get used to a new app. Had this one figured out after a few days and it seems to cover all the bases for weight loss very well. On topnof that, it seems to integrate with other apps like it claims. That should all be expected performance, but in the swamp of apps that never do what they say, its an absolute pleasure to find one that dies what it says and does it well.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Very user friendly. The barcode function makes it super easy to add food and beverages, but you can search for them as well. The ability to view my progress as a graph lets me visualize how I'm doing over time instead of just looking at overall results. I also love that it syncs with my smart watch's app to add my activities for the day.",User Interface and UX
Kim Buchheid,,,"This is a great app for tracking food with very little effort. The only thing that needs some improvement is how exercise factors in. When I do a long run outside in the summer, I need more sodium to keep my electrolytes in balance, but the app doesn't take this into account. I've also found that if I eat the extra calories the app gives me for steps I gain weight instead of losing weight, so it appears the number of calories for steps is overstated. Bottom line it's a great app!",Functionality and Features
LaChilena09,,,"Love it! Helps me to stay on track and be more mindful. I've had for at least a decade and it saves everything so when I take a break and then come back, it still has it all. Helps when eating out or processed foods and it has the most foods from restaurants and easy to substitute or get as close as possible. Can scan barcodes and that makes it very convenient.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"This app is wonderful! It was recommended by nutritionists at the Veterans hospital. It's easy to use, includes an incredible amount of foods and I love the bar code scanner. It can be customized for calorie intake, micro nutrients and much more. It has exercise and water logs. It's very motivational to see your expected weight if you keep going with your plan. The accountability of the app has helped me to lose almost 50 lbs!! My only suggestion is having a sleep log.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,I love this app! It's great for portion control and eating the right amount without all the guess work. It's tells you when you've gone over in certain areas so you can adjust if needed. I love that it saves recipes and meals you've made making it easy to go back to and add. Within the first 2 weeks I lost 2 lbs! They couldn't have made it any simpler!,Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Only been using for 2 weeks, but the application is great for daily journal. Database of foods is incredible. Nothing I haven't been able to find. Highly recommended as a nutrition tracker. Some foods have incomplete information so can sometime be difficult to search. Would like a way to vote up or down food items. That way you wouldn't have to sift through entries that aren't as complete as others.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,I used this app in the past when the barcode scanning first became available. It took forever to upload and most products wouldn't come up. I decided to try it again and am very impressed with all improvements and add on's that are available. I am still learning all the new things that are available but I have to say so far the nutrition tab is my favorite. It is very easy to see what meals you have logged are the healthiest and where you are daily on important things like sodium and sugar.,Performance and Stability
Alex Renee,,,I would like to update my review. Within a week the below issue has been resolved. FIVE STARS. I seriously love this app and the premium version. I love being able to track macros. Many restaurants food are available within the app to track making the planning of your meals easy! I love tracking my food on this app; however it is frustrating it's not syncing correctly with my Samsung health. No matter how many times I disconnect and uninstall the app.,Functionality and Features
Ashley Dymock,,,"Every time I feel like I'm starting to eat too much, this is a great tool to reign me back in and retrain my appetite! I love that I can scan barcodes (and the barcode scanner has gotten MUCH better since the last time I used the app) and get all the nutritional info. I also appreciate that I can create my own meals, foods, recipes, workouts, and more. Plus, you can import recipes from other websites! Counting calories can be time consuming but MyFitnessPal makes it convenient and easy.",User Interface and UX
A Google user,,,Upgraded to My Fitness Pal Premium to let the app do the work of computing the macros. It's been awesome. Not only in tracking but giving you all the data needed to make appropriate nutritional decisions instantly with just a few clicks. Have not had any problems and the learning curve is simply intuitive. Try it free for 30 days!,Functionality and Features
Movin' It with Mel,,,"Super easy - way better than pen and paper (yes, I did that for about a year)! I especially like that it figures my exercise into the calories I have left to consume so it both encourages me to work out more and gives me the opportunity to eat more based on the extra calories I burn. I love it. I'm currently using the free version, but now that I've had some time to learn the system, I'm considering paying for the premium version. Thanks, Carlleen (ckbmovesmore), for the recommendation!",User Interface and UX
A Google user,,,"Counting calories has always been very daunting for me. In fact, studies have shown that it CAN do more harm than good. But with the barcode scanner, and the ""recent foods"" list, it's SO EASY! I'm on a very strict, low calorie diet right now, but I wanted to make sure I was still getting all of the proper nutrients my body needs, and be able to see exactly where I'm falling short so that I can supplement appropriately. This app has really helped me to do that!",Functionality and Features
Emily Evangelista,,,"Great app to keep track of calories, proteins, fats, sugars, carbs, vitamins, & more! Easy to use! Once you add in food, it saves into your Food History & you can click the same food item each time you eat it. If the barcode pulls up the food, but the numbers do not quite match the actual product you have in your hand, then you can click ""find a better match"" button at the bottom to find the right one or click the ""create a food"" button, which you can then type everything from the label!",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Finally putting my health first, the first thing I did was download the app. It's simple and easy, and I've recommended this app to strangers as well. The only downside is, sometimes the app doesn't have basic workouts, like the elliptical; so a had to put an alternative workouts in. Plus, if I am doing a work out that is designated towards the number of sets vs the minutes, it makes it very hard to track how much calories I've lost. Otherwise, love this app and keep up the great work! :)",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"I've been using this app for about 2 weeks. It has helped me to change my eating habits and lifestyle. The food diary of excellent, you can input whatever you eat by scanning the UPC (which is incorrect less than 8% of the time) or manually. just being able to see what I eat and the calories that I was consuming has helped.

Nicole Ã¢â¬ÅMarcellaÃ¢â¬,,,"Great app! The free version helped me to lose about 30 lbs in 6 months. It also helped me to realize I needed more protein. My only problem is the exstimate of maximum calories it sets for me only works in winter. In the summer, even with regular outdoor walking (which I can't do in winter), I have to consume 120 fewer calories than the app's limit to maintain my weight. I would like it if this app considered the fact that people burn calories differently depending upon the season. Thanks!",Performance and Stability
Brandon Brackett,,,I haven't used others so this is based off does it help...yes. I've lost over 90lbs. Because I'm tracking calories and carbs and protein intake and going to the gym. Some times I wonder if the numbers are a bit off but this has helped me emensly in keeping track and losing weight I use the free version and I like it. Worth it. Don't get inundated with ads there all in the form of a news feed with those af articles and the very occasional once in 2 to 3 days pop up that clears in 5 seconds.,Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Almost every food is listed, and you can create recipes, make meals, etc. Pretty great. It can sync with Google fit as well as a lot of wearable devices (but you can also log your activities manually). Free version doesn't harass users to upgrade or watch an ad before logging things. Only experienced a couple of bugs in my about 1 1/2 years of use.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"Great app. Everything that you need is free, the premium stuff is just extra. This app has helped me to lose weight, and stay healthy and accountable.

Just check for accuracy when you are adding a new food, because sometimes it is wrong. Overall would recommend.",Functionality and Features
Zach Speck,,,"Excellent app. I highly recommend it. I love that I can scan barcodes for nutrition information, but I can also calculate it all manually and input it myself.

Used it for 3 weeks now and haven't got bored. I'm sure you can do more with it but I'm just using its basic functions. I have yet to scan a barcode it doesn't recognize and I have scanned some unusual organic or speciality items. Bottom line- This is a good app to track calories",User Interface and UX
Julian Martinez,,,"Makes watching my food so much easier. Whenever I have a food I haven't eaten before, if I scan the barcode it will stay in my list and if I have it again I can choose it from the list instead of rescanning it every time. Has all the nutritional values on display. You can set personal goals for macros consumed. This will show you where you're at each day (provided you track your foods with the app) this is all in the free version too! Great addition to your health equipment. Recommend for sure!!",Functionality and Features
Gregory Wright,,,"It can keep track of all calories, in (assuming you enter them) and out (assume you enter them). One great ""plus"" - I used a different app in the past, but this one has a bigger database of foods w/ product codes (to which you can add), and it doesn't automatically slap on the current time. Of course improvements could be made, but that's true of anything. Send the word, and update is their tool.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"Pretty legit way to keep track of nutrient intake. Personally I'm trying to gain weight, and it helps make sure I am eating enough, on a continuous basis.

Chris Roop,,,"Keeping a food log is the best way to impact your eating behavior. I've done it manually but it isn't sustainable. Good data comes from consistent input. The app not only makes it possible, it reminds you when you forget or get busy. The more I use it the more ways I find to make it easier. There are actions that have a learning curve and places that can be improved, but that will happen and in the meantime I'm generating significant data that will help me in the long term.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"Most important for me in a fitness/weight loss app is ease of use, because if it's too complicated, I know I'm going to give up on it. I love that it allows you to build a recipe of your own for a complete meal that serves 8, and then allows you to choose just one serving for yourself. The only thing that bugs me is that I've synched the fitness tracker thing that came preloaded on my phone, but for some reason, it doesn't transfer my steps. That's an really minor issue, though.",Performance and Stability
William Berry,,,"So far, so good. I use it for the calorie tracking. Which has been the most helpful to me. The other aspects are ok. It's social aspects are also lacking, but I'm actually fine with that. As the calorie tracking is my primary use. Adding ones exercises is lacking, as I use machines only at my gym and this app doesn't support enough machine options for me. So yeah, great calorie tracking, only ok on everything else. Still love it.",Functionality and Features
A Google user,,,"I used this app several years ago and tried to use a few others before coming back to this one. Compared to other apps, this one shows a lot more nutritional data for free, which I love! It is very easy to log what I eat and see how I can change my diet to meet my personal eating goals. I had initially switched apps because I wanted something more nutrition focused, rather than calorie focused, but this has ended up being the best of both.",Performance and Stability
A Google user,,,"Very happy with app. It has been beneficial in helping me understand the delicate balance between calories and exercise.

Aubrey Gonzalez,,,"Previously I would have given the app 5 stars but not after the update. As other users have indicated, you are not able to see as many metrics up at the top as before which is frustrating. However, the biggest issue for me is how monotone and ugly the whole thing is.

When it has worked, I had to persistently try again & again & again (& again & again) before it worked - it took forever for the devices to communicate the data to each other, usually consuming as much as 5%+ of my phone's battery. I wish they had spent more time fixing this problem than coming out with new devices so they could continue to sell poor products.",Customer Support and Responsiveness

After almost a week of trying to sync and log in to the app, finally got in yesterday! Can't believe you took a program that was sleek and very well designed and turned it into something that looks like a high school student designed it after one coding class!

Beth Ulrich,,,"The ""improved functionality"" really doesn't improve anything. Too much white and drab colors. Nothing is eye-catching. There used to be a heart rate fat-burning zone, and that is no longer. I can't edit my workouts, even if my watch/the app get the distance wrong (which has been almost daily for the past few months). Between the useless app and my watch that's been incorrect on heart rate, distance, and other things lately, I'll be looking elsewhere for a fitness watch this holiday season.",Functionality and Features
Sharli Grove,,,"I've been greatly disappointed with fitbit over the past year. Last winter, they discontinued the challenges. I actually found great motivation in those. The most recent update has been another 2 steps back. Not only is the home screen dull, but you can no longer customize the specifics of what you see. You have no choice in the order your items you track are listed in. I just bought my newest fitbit this summer, and I'm regretting it now. I'm ready to switch products.

Esther G,,,"New layout is too big and clunky and not at all the way I desire to view the data. Somehow you all have gone backwards instead of forward. I actually don't use the app as much as I used to because it is so dang annoying and inconvenient to get the data I want. I will absolutely not be continuing on with Fitbit in the future and will be evaluating other fitness devices. After weeks on this layout, there is no getting used to it. It is a failure from both design and functionality.",Functionality and Features

You have to select a special focus. And that just isn't ideal. Google is trying to out think us and it just doesn't work. I'm following up to the work around from Google/Fitbit. I've had to uninstall it and then reinstall it to get it to work. It worked for about a week and has stopped again.,Functionality and Features
Rick Riggi,,,"1 star for the newest update. All of my data is difficult to find, and even harder to interpret. I used to be able to look at my heart zones from workouts with ease, but the plots now make no sense as the colors for the different heart zones are nearly identical. Also, they took away the ability to see battery percentage in the app which is critical when charging your watch. It's almost as if they want you to destroy the battery by removing your device from its charger too soon.",Performance and Stability

Everything looks the same so there's hardly any way to tell the units apart when I'm scrolling so I have to really search for what I'm looking for. Waste of time.

It missed two normal exercise days this week since the update and didn't track a 2+ hour nap I wanted to look at.",Functionality and Features
vanessa hoffeditz,,,The upgrades to the Fitbit app are awful. The graphics are bland. It is hard to find the information you need. To find the calories burned from each category is difficult to find . Previously it would show the amount of time you were in a fat burn during an activity. You are not able to see the splits of your walks or runs on the map anymore. The map details are now minimal. Am looking at other options from other companies with these changes.,Functionality and Features

Meg S,,,"Latest update is awful! The app was the best thing about fitbit. Not anymore. They've removed significant customization options. Instead of being able to individually pick what stats you want on the dashboard you chose a ""focus"" and those 4 stats are at the top.

I'd love to get an new Fitbit, but I have ZERO confidence that it will sync. :(",Functionality and Features
Liam Toohey,,,"It's hard to find anything positive to say about the app redesign. The muted colors remove the enthusiasm I had for checking data, the design is less intuitive, and the functionality seems to work less well. Additionally the redesign only affects the homepage which makes for a disconnect when you navigate to other screens. I'm not sure if this was just poorly tested, or an effort to push users to Google Fit, but either way I'll likely cancel my premium membership when it's up for renewal.",Compatibility and Device Issues
S Coston,,,"Very much preferred the old interface! My watch works Great and the old interface was well designed and easy to use. Google, don't change things just because you can. Ask first! Don't try to fix this interface, just go back to the old one. Cons: colors to dull and similar, too much scrolling, you averaged data that should be unique, you put important data at the Bottom of pages instead of the top, some chart are just Gone! Just a poor design!",Functionality and Features
Joanne M,,,"The new app update is awful. If I didn't like my Fitbit so much I would switch to a different product because of the app. The visual presentation is hard to read because of the monochromatic (and ugly) color, it does not organize the info in a visually intuitive way, it's too large and spread out so requires too much scrolling. The previous design was a five so not sure why you would intentionally make your product worse.",Functionality and Features
Evan Mapson,,,"Can no longer edit the type of auto-recorded exercises, instead automatically picking arbitrary things like ""aerobic"" or ""sport"". Manually added exercises no longer show heart rate or other data like they used to (estimated as it was).

Maia,,,"What was the point of this update. The colors aren't vibrant. The zone colors on the graphs are not accessible since there's not enough contrast between it. The colors before were intuitive with red, orange, yellow, and blue. The quick view on the home screen is less detailed. There's not even a dark mode. I'm fact it's even brighter than before.

Tanya Mysko,,,"The new UI is a no. As a designer I know new designs take time to adjust, but some of the changes do not make sense. I have to scroll to find anything I need (almost six full screens for all the info that used to take up far less space). There is a sameness that makes me just gloss over data and I struggle to find what I need. I do like the more minimal charting style, and colors feel more modern. I will try for a little longer and may abandon. Please add compact layout version and a dark mode.",Functionality and Features
Richard Adler,,,"As many have said already, the recent redesign is a complete UI failure. Difficult to read, bland and boring, and considerably less useful. The old design was very good and reasonablyintuitive. It simply did not need to be rethought, especially in such an amateurish and user hostile way. I used to recommend Fitbit, but if this is a sign of where they're going, those days are passing fast. If they're smart, they'll revert to the old version, but I'm not holding my breath.",Functionality and Features
Erich von Hauske,,,"Pretty UI at the expense of ease of use. the latest version requires a lot more effort to view your history for a metric, to the point that it is not usable.

I was going to buy a new watch but I'll wait until this is fixed.",Functionality and Features
Fran Heddings,,,"I've used this app for many years and loved it, until the recent update. The home screen UI isn't user-friendly. The battery level no longer displays, the icons and labels take up too much space, and other essential functionality has been removed or degraded. Including the weekly goal percentage for zone minutes. Now I need to do math to figure it out. Not convenient. Fitbit, please rollback to the previous version.",Functionality and Features
John Wickham,,,"Oct 2023 app redesign is a huge step backwards. What happened to the battery percentage that was always available and showed in the sync? Now users have to take multiple steps just to get an approximate battery level... Ridiculous. Asthecally it does look cleaner. The UX asks the user to ""prioritize"" what they'd like to see which could be useful for some. Not for me. It wasn't very difficult to scroll down a bit to see what wasn't on top or tap for details.",Functionality and Features
C. Thomas,,,"This latest upgrade is terrible. It misses syncing portions of the activities. For example, it did not sync the last segment of my sleep or the last segment of the hourly activity. It is difficult to read and needs too many steps to get to the information I want. The older version, while not perfect, was much easier to use. At least, it was syncing properly.",Functionality and Features
Nicholas Harrison,,,"Not working well since the update Ok, so the update is very minimalist in terms of color and that isn't appealing for me, but the real issue is not only does it seem like it stopped synching in the background with my watch, there are times when it just fails to synch at all. Again, not an issue before the update so I don't think it's a hardware thing. My watch is less than a year old. I do like the custom dashboard with goals, and the disappearance of the ""tips"" that were unnecessary.",Functionality and Features
Jerry Ham,,,"This design refresh is bad (for example you cannot put the items you want into the order that you want, you can only move groups that are, within themselves, order locked. This means more scrolling to see what you want. Also, for some reason, the heart rate panel won't even open. Tapping the icon brings up a screen that just clocks forever. All in all, needed some people who actually use it to tell the designers to go back to the drawing board. it is clearly put together by folks that don't use.",Functionality and Features
Jeannette Hill,,,"A problem that has carried over from the older app version is that after I sync, I have to close out the app and open it again for any steps that were synced to show up in the graphs. After the most recent update, location services must be enabled all the time in order to sync with the Fitbit. It was much better before, when I could enable it only while using the app. When it comes time to replace my Fitbit, I will be checking out other options if this is still required.",Functionality and Features
David Cammack,,,"The new Fitbit app look is worse. This seems to be a trend with most products, especially software--over time, they get worse. The metrics are dull and harder to distinguish. The dashboard is comprehensively less informative, and the color scheme is more bland. While I Iike the increased functionality (which is why I gave it 2 stars), I'd rather have the old look back.",User Interface and UX
Lee Martin,,,"I'm very disappointed in this new revision. I have been actively using Fitbit since 2012, and this is the biggest jump backward so far. My primary areas of concern are colors, font size, GPS mapping, and the ability to organize screens to meet my needs. I was afraid that acquisition by Google was going to be a hostile takeover and these ""improvements"" seem to support this theory.",Performance and Stability
Mike Lieder,,,"App redesign is alright once you get used to it, but doesn't seem necessary and isn't an improvement on what was there. It also took away the ability to edit an exercise type after. For instance, it automatically records me mowing the lawn as mountain biking. Before I could just edit that and everything was fine, but now you can't even edit this.",Performance and Stability
Julie F (JulieNStLouie),,,"The latest app update messed up my fitbit inspire 2. The new version wants to to sync with Google. It will no longer pair on Bluetooth. It shuts down often and no longer syncs my data. I tried to chat with Fitbit, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong (3 different people). They left me out in the cold. I am very disappointed. Now I have to spend more time tomorrow to try to fix it and also try calling customer service.",Functionality and Features
Anna L,,,"Another big update that doesn't help. They changed the color scheme for heart rate zones in maps and charts to a muted, ugly design that makes it harder to differentiate between zones. I like that I can customize what appears on my screen, because I want to spend as little time as possible in the app. I think the next time I buy a fitness tracker, I'll be moving away from FitBit, because the app keeps getting worse.",Performance and Stability
Mandy B,,,"The update to the layout is terrible. I've been using the app to monitor my heart rate during my workouts and now that chart is gone. So is the zone chart.

Edited to add: App won't let you edit the type of workout either, you have to delete the whole thing and manually add it back to change it.",Functionality and Features
Doneka D'Amore,,,"I hate the new update. I used to get on it several times a day, tracking my food, my water, inputting my workouts if my Fitbit happened to be dead at the time of exercise, checking sleep scores, etc etc. It was inviting, bright, colorful, fun to use, engaging, easy to navigate and explore. Now it's the embodiment of the audio for the Clear Eyes commercial. Looking at the monochromatic dashboard and the new layout sucks the joy right out of me. Why, Fitbit? Why???",Functionality and Features
Brandon Farinha,,,"Hate the new update. The monochrome style is horrible, it's harder to navigate, and it's not syncing correctly. I did a 3 mile walk this morning and the app is saying i only put in 1.75 despite the fact that the map shows the route taken. Also the new map view is pointless, as it no longer shows mile markers. The whole interface looks like a 5 year old's refrigerator drawing.",Performance and Stability
Daniella Rollman,,,"Hate the new updated look on the app, dislike the forced change to Google, which changed it even further. There isn't a way to change it back to the original look.

Because of how cumbersome this is, you're actually driving my traffic to other integrated apps for me to be able to see what I want.",Functionality and Features
Judy collier,,,"I am not a fan. It is inconsistent and hard to sync. It doesn't always update promptly and sometimes one value updates, but others don't.Too much white space, and I don't like having my weight displayed.

Elisa Lambert,,,"I love this app, but the new redesign is awful. I would have rated four or five stars prior to the change. Some info I used a lot is gone like the heart rate zones chart for a workout. Navigation in general is clunkier and things are a little more burried on the app. Rather than being clean and sleek which I assume was the intended design, it is much harder to see the information since everything blends together. I hope they fix it!",User Interface and UX
Michael Vinson,,,"This app was great, that is until the latest update. Before you could edit an activity to change the duration and the app would adjust calories, etc. You could change the type of exercise that was automatically detected and it would recalculate based on the new type of exercise. None of that works now. Based on this update, I can no longer recommend getting Fitbit Premium. All of the useful benefits are no longer available.",Performance and Stability
Robin Swecker,,,The app used to give you the option to set silent alarms and change them easily. I have used the alarms daily for years. Now you have to log into a desktop account and dig layers deep to find and change the alarms. Update after Sept 2023 app update. I reduced to 2 stars because the new layout is visually less appealing and harder to customize to what you want to track. Makes me want to switch to a different product.,Performance and Stability
Rafe S,,,"Dark mode! This app needs a dark mode or to not interfere with my phones dark mode. Because of the update I can't keep my phones dark mode on because it makes stuff on this app invisible.

Finally, I want to be able to see the graph show the last 7, 30 days, 3, 12 months; not just a static set of time.",Performance and Stability
Yvonne Hernandez,,,"The new app is too bright. Add the option to add some dark colors to the layout that will be easier on the eyes and can differentiate between the different metric categories.

Now we have to scroll more times because we are seeing less data at every screen. This is very inefficient.",Functionality and Features
Susan Hawk,,,"The new ""clean look"" app is terrible. Not enough visual data with my exercises. I miss the daily tips that used to appear when I opened the app. It looks boring AF.

I should not need to do this. I want the old app back.",Functionality and Features
LK Sochay,,,"The new UI in the app is awful - not intuitive at all - wasting too much of my time trying to find things that I used to use everyday. Didn't save previous preferences. Users have no interest in learning another layout and resetting what they've already set in the app previously. Also, there was no quick walk-thru tutorial to show a user what has changed and how to navigate it. Yet another reason to start looking for something different next time I need to buy a fitness watch.",Functionality and Features
Kim Craven,,,"Revised rating. The latest update in October 2023 is extremely disappointing. I wear my Fitbit on a clip on my body. There are no longer options for wearing it as a clip. It only counts steps as if it was on an arm. That's not how all of your users use this application. It changed my step count. Additionally, I am not happy that they took away the battery indicator. Some of us use that on the app to know when we need to recharge. Please put it back.",Functionality and Features
Jennifer Saksa,,,The lastest version has been a downgrade. Some of what I used most is either harder to see or non existent despite having lots of things I had to turn off. I'm glad you can turn off elements but rearranging elements is more limited than it was.

Tracy Doeppers,,,"Works well for tracking steps & weight. But the sleep tracking is truly frustrating. At least 1-2/wk, it doesn't track sleep, so i have no metrics. I'm not doing anything different, so there's no good reason for this. It also has trouble detecting when sleep starts, & I have to edit at least once/wk.

Norm Bryan,,,"The update is suboptimal; that is, it is less developed than what it replaced. It no longer tracks pulse rate nor the resting rate thus losing for me an important function. Update Thank you, Fitbit, for the response but it does not address the app, rather it addresses the fitbit device. The device tracks pulse; the app which syncs to the device does not, nor does it provide such as an option. In my regard, the update is less functional than before, however such may not be an issue for others.",Functionality and Features
Adrian Nicholls,,,"It's ok but the latest update appears to have removed battery percentage charged with low/medium/high which is not nearly as useful.

Alexandrea Brown,,,"The app was fairly easy to use prior to the most recent update. I like that they've included a menstrual health tab now and made the video workouts page easier to filter through and find what you need.

Destiny Frost,,,"Yeah I appreciate Fitbit trying to finally update the UI after all of these years but I feel like it went in the wrong direction. I think the reason why it feels harder to read is because all of the components have the same color whereas before different components had their own colors and look to them.

Wondering if this tracker isn't compatible with Chomp SMS app which is my default message app. Thanks. Edit/Update...LOL, I'm not sure what I did to make this work now. Changed a setting in the Chomp SMS app and restarted the tracker, but it worked! Getting vibration for texts now.",Performance and Stability
Pam McStay,,,"I really like this app. That said, the new updates released in the past week are graphically disappointing. I liked the layout and colors before. This version is dry and boring.

Kiara Littlejohn,,,"This app has been super helpful in my fitness journey (down 30 lbs!), but it could use some improvements. The menstrual tracker is NOT easy to use...it's basically nonfunctional.

Betty Adams,,,"The Charge 4 has been a great tracker for me. Steps, sleep, goals, and vitals are basically what I have used it for. There was a period when I was not able to wear it, and when I came back, it seemed like some options had been moved over to the premium subscription. That was disappointing. And I really do miss the challenges. Technically, the tracker has been working great, I've had it for several years and only had to replace the wrist band recently.",Functionality and Features

Scrolling down to find a food is time consuming. Even on the site it isn't easy to delete things- only if they're custom- where you add them yourself.",Functionality and Features
Lydia Glider-Shelley,,,"I'm pretty happy with the device. However, could you PLEASE program it so that the voice prompt lets us know if/when the GPS is lost, so we can stop and reconnect, for a more accurate representation of our routes? Also, having the pulse oximetry measured at night is good, but it would be wonderful to see a graph detailing ups and downs in our O2 and what time the lows occur. I'd also like my fitbit to vibrate or make a sound to wake me up if my pulse ox falls too low. (Below 90)",User Interface and UX
Una Whitfield,,,I have been a loyal user since a Versa 2 was given to me as a gift. I experienced syncing problems prior to my anniversary date. I was given a replacement. Which I received in May. Now this device is doing the same and more such as not syncing and now not registering and not charging. Now they are saying the device is out of warranty. How? When the replacement device isn't even a year old. I am done. Fitbit can go jump in the lake. It isn't a reliable device and the Versa2 isn't.,Functionality and Features
Beverly Lewis,,,"Generally speaking, it does keep track of steps, heart rate, distance, and sleep. However to get other information, one has to subscribe to Premium for 9.99 per month.

I have the Inspire 2, and you can choose exercises like running, swimming, weight lifting, treadmill, or HIIT. But sometimes I do yoga or other exercises. No way to register that.",Performance and Stability
Jessie Herr,,,"One thing that I'd really like to see, is a revamp on the food logging, such as being able to manually save favorite foods for easier tracking- instead of trying to scroll through lists looking for it or typing/searching for it.

Mike Freeman,,,"Solid Info, Easy to Use. Sync can be janky. The app presents daily activity and workouts in pleasant format. Sleep tracking is a plus. But the best sleep data is paywalled. Not unusual these days, but still not great for the user. The sync with my Pixel watch is just barely adequate. Takes a good 20 mins in morning for sleep data to push up to the app. Sometimes I still have to directly open the app on the watch to for the phone app to sync. For two Google products, should be better.",Functionality and Features
Dian Sesma,,,"I have a fitbit charge 5. The app is pretty general and easy to use. I'm disappointed in the clock face options. They aren't very creative or colorful. Would be nice to be able to create my own. Another part of the app that needs improvement is the food logging. You can't delete items that are no longer needed, and it keeps multiples of the same food items on the logger list. Which makes it a waste of space and time looking for a particular item. Same title items should become 1.",Functionality and Features
Cara Carlson,,,"I have been using this app and Fitbit devices since 2015, and I agree that they are very user-friendly. However, these are the things I have noticed could improve this app: The menstrual tracking needs to be more customizable and allow you to input your own symptoms. Meditations need to be able to be manually entered, the mediations available in the app are short, and there aren't very many. Also, watches need to stop counting steps while in a biking workout. It's double counting activity.",User Interface and UX
mizCD 1,,,"I've had the Inspire 2 for about 8 months now. I've enjoyed using this app for the step counter, sleep tracker, and food tracker. I'm not sure how accurate the pedometer is, but the fact that I can set a reminder to move helps me out significantly at work all day. In addition, I find sometimes when you scan the barcoodes for food items the codes don't always correspond to the correct food, or if companies have updated the calorie count, the fitbit database doesn't have the updated count.",Functionality and Features

A Google user,,,"The app itself is fine. The dashboard is lightly customizable and you can turn various functions on and off. I use a fitbit for step tracking and that's about it, really, so the app and hardware do what I need it to do. However, some more customization options in the dashboard and a more stable syncing process would be nice. Additionally, not a huge fan of having to turn my location on to get a sync on my fitbit 2. That seems like a bit of a stretch to me. In any case, the app works fine for what I need it for. Those who need something hardcore may be disappointed though.",Functionality and Features

This has not improved with the new app version, by the way.",Functionality and Features
Dennis Heinle,,,"This app has been pretty solid for me after switching to a Pixel 6/Fitbit Sense. The sleep, water and exercise tracking are great. However, the food tracking is terrible. The database is bloated with a bunch of duplicate or out-of-date information, you have to add things one-at-a-time, the search is bad and rarely finds anything even in the ballpark of what I look for and you can't create recipes in app and if you use the web site to track anything, it'll often break the sync for that thing.",Functionality and Features
Jalisa Johnson,,,"Overall, a pretty good app to be paired with my device. Other than the bugs I experience here and there, I don't have any serious complaints. But I do have a suggestion.

Overall this is a great app, what keeps me from giving it five stars is the fact that it has a bug that has not been fixed.

It helps me with daily exercise and meditation, recipes, water intake, heart rate etc....It does everything! It connects to my watch. I would strongly suggest it. This app is amazing.",Functionality and Features
Verna Wilson,,,"I rnjoy the app and it helps me keep motivated. The only problems I have is with syncing, but I think it is more with my phone than the device. Usually it will sync after I turn my phone off and back on.",Performance and Stability
Charles Ross,,,"For everyone here complaining about the new look, I feel the exact opposite to you and I'm absolutely loving the redesign! I really love the theme which to me is a more professional, clear & consice, minimalist type of layout. I just bought the Luxe for my Mom so the changes couldn't have come at a better time. Keep up the great work and thank you so much for it.",Performance and Stability
Martha Mittelstaedt,,,I just love my Fitbit & this app keeps me moving ! I have had a Fitbit for years now & I'm very happy that I can keep moving each day ! I really get excited when I get my 10 of 10 each day ! The only thing I don't like is it never gets my sleep right . It records that I sleep less than my sleep machine does sometimes hours less. I'm sure addicted to Fitbit because it helps me feel good about myself! Thank you so much Ã¢,Functionality and Features
Irfan Mirza,,,I had some concerns. This app is complete and constructive. It provides greater than I need on daily basis. But there's one thing that i have to do every now and then. I need to tap manually on the steps widget many times a day enable it to display the steps although the app counts within it. Why is this? RAM management?,Functionality and Features
Margaret Brock,,,"Very disappointed with the new app. I do yoga, but it's not on the list of auto recognised activity. I added yoga to my Charge 3, but now with my Charge 5, I have to add it manually. I don't like the new app! So much more difficult to navigate. Many of the options have disappeared.",Functionality and Features
oioioi - 99,,,"The server was down yesterday (for several hours), and the failure happened to coincide with the latest update, so my first impression wasn't great. Now everything is working fine again, and I think the update is pretty good. It certainly looks much better than before.",User Interface and UX

Craig,,,"Used the new update and the Fitbit watch stopped pairing. Wow really Fitbit. UPDATE: Thanks Fitbit for responding so quickly, much appreciated, I found the link you provided helpful, I was able to find my Versa 2 with a deep dive in to the search pages, I restarted both the watch and the app, that seemed to work!! Everything is back up and running, thanks! Good looking new update on the app I might add !!",Functionality and Features
