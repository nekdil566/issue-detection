Msanza,1.0 out of 5 stars,No response from tech support,"The built in print driver on my Fire HD 8 could not find my old Brother printer. I needed something else and I found this which claimed to support my exact printer. I was not fooled like other reviewers. I knew this app was not free. First I downloaded the free app and ran a print test page. The test page color pattern came out fine. Success! Then I paid for the upgrade to the full version to print real documents. But no matter what I do, it prints only the first page and then stops. I sent email to tech support and asked for help or a refund. Nothing. Not even a reply to say they could not help me.I have seen other reviewers says that it works for them. That is great, but it definitely did not work for me and I got no help from them... not even an acknowledgement. If this is the kind of customer service they offer, all I can say is buyer beware! The test page in the free app does not guarantee that it will print real docs for you....",,Customer Support and Responsiveness

Mr Wizard,1.0 out of 5 stars,BOY DO I WISH I HAD READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE,"CAPITALIZATION in this review is NOT screaming ... just highlighting ...My initial ""review to myself"" was positive, when I tested a plain, short ""Word"" style document. It seemed to work just fine, and NOBODY releases software that doesn't work do they? snort!!! So I bought the program, and BOY! am I SORRY! that I did so, because I can now no longer get a refund as I have struggled SO long and SO hard, trying to make this piece of software do the simplest tasks.There is SO much of this app that either just plain does not work, or has VERY limited functionality, or does not work quite right, that I CANNOT in good conscience recommend this app to ANYONE for ANY reason.I have written to Support twice, and beyond the ""We have received your request..."" email notice, I have received NO response whatsoever to my request for assistance or clarification.The so called HELP system is more a list of what the menu options are than they are instructions on how to use this app. As a help system, it is WOEFULLY, and PITIFULLY inadequate. So mix the fact that parts of it, despite being available to the user, just do not work, the lack of reliable support and the lack of a comprehensive help system, and you get a miserable, FAILED attempt at a piece of software that should not have gone to market for a SIGNIFICANT additional period of time for development.And when I bought this, my ONLY option was a subscription so that I have to pay for it again, and AGAIN, EVERY year. What the heck happened to just being able to BUY a piece of software?These people need a couple of million bucks of investment money so that they can do some more development on this software so that it WORKS, and works COMPLETELY before they start selling it. As it stands, it needs a LOT more development. While SOME small parts of it DO work, it is NOT a replacement for microsoft office. There is just too much of it that does not work to warrant buying this app.I just CANNOT imagine a greater waste of money. This is probably THE worst purhase that I have EVER made online.",,Functionality and Features

Solaris,1.0 out of 5 stars,New Updates,"So got my kindle for Christmas and was happy that it came with this app cause I finally had a mobile Skype. Didn't enjoy the fact that if I had my keyboard up in the IMs that I couldn't see if someone was messaging me, from what my sister says she has the same problem on her phone. I learned to deal with it, simply close the keyboard randomly to check if that orange ""1"" is flashing. Most annoying was that even if I signed out Skype would still display me as online causing me to uninstall the app whenever I didn't want to appear online.Fast forward to today and I download Skype to find it has a new update,and a crappy one at that. Now it has ""tablet mode"" and ""smart phone mode"" which are supposed to be ""optimized"" for that type of device. Which is an outright lite given that I'm on a kindle and using the smartphone mode because it's the only one that flips with the screen. Why they removed the screen matching the position of the tablet but kept it for the phone is beyond me.While a complete and utter bell/whistle they even removed the profile picture that appears next to the person's name while in chat.",,Compatibility and Device Issues
ijess,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skype/useless,"I got a kindle to take travelling with me, partly to use Skype to keep in touch with home. All worked brilliantly till an automatic up date, supposedly making Skype better for the tablet, downloaded it's self. I've paid to have a number on Skype and do use credit to make some calls and send texts, but I've found that being a paying customer means nothing to Skype, I am evidently worthless to them.  It was near impossible to contact anyone at Skype, it's really hard to get to the point that you can actually communicate with someone and when I finally did they weren't helpful at all.  So I got in touch with Amazon, they were great and gave me a way to overcome the problems I've been having. Albeit a temporary fix.The problems I've had have included, not being able to sign in, the control panel disappearing so I cannot sign in or out (once signed out automatically there was no way to sign back in), see what credit I have or access my profile. Losing all records of any texts that I have sent and paid for. The programme constantly crashes.Having got home from travelling I have again contacted Skype to try and resolve the problem.  Several emails have been exchanged, they have collected data from me about the problem and now have closed the case without having resolved the problem at all. I have lost money because of the problems I've had, directly from my Skype credit, I shall never see that again.  Skype is a disgrace, if anything goes wrong with the programme they are useless, it appears to be a waste of time contacting them, they don't understand their own product.",,Performance and Stability

Little did I know they would restart the service 6 months later without any notice and charged me $80. I called customer service and they said there was nothing they could do and refused any sort of refund. I'm sure they have the terms written and I honestly just screwed up when pausing instead of canceling, but restarting the service without some kind of notice and charging me 6 months later has certainly put me off the service permanently.

In that time, the amount of recorded shows that had technical difficulties and crashed without recording the rest of the episode or having to start all over and find where it crashed is substantial.  And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.  Even when you finally figure out the completely unintuitive actions you have to take to pull up a menu while watching a show, you have to do it over and over and over before it actually does it.  The frustration level with this service is way beyond what its worth at one of the highest price points of all streaming services.

I noticed the day after the charge, contacted customer service and asked if I could get a refund explaining the situation (and the fact I was strapped for cash this month).  They told me no, which I can understand due to the agreement, but it is still frustrating considering I will not be using the service at all in the time I'm paying and I haven't used it since the second day of the trial.  I had this situation once before with Hulu, and they quickly refunded me and I subscribed again once I could afford the payments (yay Hulu!).  They earned a customer for life by doing that.  I think Fubo could learn from that example, honestly.Recommendation: Sling TV offers a better bang for your buck (that's the service I decided to go with since it's less expensive and offers the channels I want).

Unfortunately, during my free trial period I experienced a lot of problems with the video being pixelated.  I thought it was just one channel, so I switched to the Weather Channel.  It worked well for a while, but then began to do the same thing.  This issue occurred while at my vacation house.  When I got home I installed the app on my Amazon TV.  There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.  This some times only occurs for a few seconds and other times I have to close and re-open the app.  It's too bad this channel doesn't appear ready for Prime Time.

James Altemus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Random commercials on certain channels are a feature, not a bug","We switched to fuboTV from another streaming service because the other service dropped a key channel for us. The service works well enough, though for a live sports-focused streaming service, the lack of anything ESPN and the lack of alternate/back channel functionality on the remote are curious choices, but something we've adapted to.What really bothers me about fuboTV is their ad delivery. fuboTV has figured out a way to insert ad breaks into live events like soccer, which are generally broadcast without commercial interruption. My issue is that they are using this technology on channels that run pre-recorded programming that already includes commercial breaks. For example, when my kids are watching a show Cartoon Network or Nick/Nick Jr., in the middle of a show segment an block of one or two ads for products not targeted to children (Geico, Red Lobster, etc.) will pop up. The show returns when the ads are complete, but since the technology doesn't pause the underlying program, part of it is lost. Keep in mind that this is in addition to the pre-set commercial breaks in the programs where they will sometime insert local or regional spots over the national spots. I've contacted fuboTV about this issue on a couple of occasions, and while they seem responsive and it does stop for a while, eventually it starts up again. At this point I'm convinced that this is by design.Fix these things and I'll stick with fuboTV. Otherwise, I'm waiting for YouTube TV to be available on FireTV so I can switch.",,Functionality and Features

There is no realtime guide onscreen during a broadcast, you hit the back button you go to a guide at the first listed channel, so you have to scroll down again and again. It buffers but no more than Direct TV and Hulu (Sling did not). I would love to use fubo but the interface was written by someone who obviously does not use it.I would rather pay more for a UI that you can navigate than this.

Bob Emmerich,2.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst functioning Fire Tv Stick apps,"I'm doing a free 7 day trial of FuboTV on the Amazon Fire Stick I've had for about a year now. I've tried a lot of streaming apps but this one just won't stream without difficulties.  My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now.

cmdodd11,4.0 out of 5 stars,Getting Closer,"WHAT OTHERS HAVE MARKED THIS OFF FORContinuing to charge them after cancellation: I am continuing my subscription, so I cannot comment on this.Freezing: I watched the third place World Cup game and had no issues. I watched Leicester v. Man U and it only froze once when I took it to mobile and left the house. A few other PL games on NBC Sports have frozen for a minute or two. But overall, I do not get what others talk about when they say that it is so terrible. Even cable has its moments, sometimes much worse.Bad picture: Looks fine to me. Maybe the first ten seconds aren't great, but again, isn't that true with almost anything?Slow loading: Okay, here I have a hack. When I start fubo.tv from my Amazon Fire TV homepage, a loading circle comes up, often with the fubo background, but not always. It will rarely come out of this by itself. But I have noticed that if I press the back button, it immediately snaps out of it and doesn't take me back but instead takes me directly to fubo. Odd thing, but in the end, it's fine for me.You cannot rewind a live game, the way that you can on NBC Sports apps or Fox Soccer Match Pass, et al: Accurate. Goals may happen and you won't be able to see them if you are not there at the exact time or you didn't record it.MY MARKDOWNSPremier League: You think that you are getting NBC Sports, Bravo, USA (?)--every possible network you could in order to watch the Premier League (aside from the money-grubbing NBC Sports Gold). But you forget the obvious: NBC. It comes with your local Fox and CBS, but not ABC or NBC. I have found articles on fubo that say that with the TVEverywhere app, you can log-in to the NBCSports app with your fubo credentials and it will treat it like a cable subscription. This has not been the case for me. I am not clear why I was rejected, other than a message that said something like ""We're sorry, this provider does not have retransmission rights in your region"". From a fubo page, it appears that NBC in my market (Oklahoma City) is not carried (while others like Tulsa and tons of other markets are). I have confirmed this both on the NBC Sports site and on the app, where I have received the same message. So if I were 90 miles to the NW, then I would have this? This is not progress. The fubo article also says that I must have the TVEverywhere channel in my fubo subscription in order for this to work, yet when I search fubo packages for this channel, I find no such listing.Champions League: Heads up--I thought that I would be getting TBS & TNT, and the last I heard, the Champions League was moving to this family of stations in the coming year. But those are not actually included. I just overlooked it.How to make this better: NBC sucks. When it split its games across NBC, Bravo, USA, NBC Sports, it could act like it is helping the fan, but then when it puts some things on a platform like fubo and others, like NBC, not, then that's a big pain. It is either mistakenly not considering this or it is intentionally doing this for its own benefit to make things like this more cumbersome for the consumer, hoping that they buy something like fubo/sling and cable on top of it. I look forward to when NBC and others catch on to how they could make even more money by making life easier for the consumer rather than harder. After all, I hardly watch American football at all anymore. Everyone can turn you off.But what does that mean for fubo? I would like to see fubo make it easier to see NBC, or to at least have my questions answered. It knows that I want to see the Premier League. So list every game. When I click on it, tell me that it is on NBC Sports or Bravo, which I have, and take me there. If that particular game is on NBC Sports Gold, tell me that, and maybe NBC will pay for that ad. If it is actually on NBC itself, then give me a brief and clear instruction on how to watch NBC, and if I cannot, then please tell me why.I also don't find the guide that helpful. I prefer not to look at what is on TV currently because by the time you scroll through all your channels, if you want to go back up to the top and watch something that you saw up there, it takes so long just to get up there. I wind up perusing just the networks, where it lists them in rows of four, which allows me to scroll through to the channel that I want faster, if not the exact programming.WHAT IT GETS RIGHTI watch mostly BBC World News, HGTV, and sports-related channels. The Fubo network is pretty good--kind of like ESPN classic for soccer, but without actual game film. It also has Bein Sports, which has worked well the few times that I have watched it so far. The website is also pretty good.OVERALLIt does great with giving access to French and Spanish games via Bein Sports, which is nice. However, it offers access to only roughly 1/2 of Premier League games, due to some being on NBC itself and some being on NBC Sports Gold. And it does not offer Champions League games in English at all, although worldsoccertalk.com appears to say that I could watch Champions League and Europa League games in Spanish on Univision, which is on fubo. I don't have a problem with that if it will really happen. But what I want to see is an option where you can click on the sport and then the competition; it does have this, but if I am to judge by that, then that points out a few things: (1) No Serie A; (2) No Champions League or Europa League; (3) just 5/10 Premier League games on this particular weekend.As a stand-alone service judged compared to cable, I am pleased with this. It doesn't give you everything, but it does give you some international soccer extras and things like CBS Sports. Comparing to something like Sling, it appears that Sling wins on your regular cable networks, though they are comparable. But if you are really a big soccer fan, understand that you are basically comparing Bein Sports + $10 to TNT/TBS & ESPN, aka La Liga and Ligue 1 to the Champions League and whatever soccer ESPN offers. If you care a great deal about Mexican and South American games, then that will push up fubo in your eyes.",,Performance and Stability

Jason Juniewicz,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hockey fans but needs work on buffering,"I love this app because I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t want a cable package but wanted to be able to watch the Devils this season. Fubo is the only service that includes MSG and has an app on the FireStick.

I experience significant buffering and skipping, sometimes all out freezes that cause me to have to restart the stream. None of my other apps do this, so I have to lay the blame with the app. This can be incredibly bad when watching an exciting game and you get a freeze right as a big play is being made.

Rolling Eagle,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cancelled before 7 day trial ended.,"1.  Pricing is deceptive.

P. Rey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not quite ready for primetime,"I'm currently in the FuboTV seven day trial. Thus far, I've found a few bugs in the Fire TV app. (At least, if you're using the Fire TV Game Controller.) Pause, fast forward and reverse do not work. On the game controller, pressing the ""A"" button pauses Amazon, Sling, DirecTV Now and Playstation Vue playback. It does not, however, work with Fubo. Additionally, if you exit playback mid-program, there is no ""resume"" feature. Conversely, playback on a PC has no problems whatsoever. I just much prefer watching TV on an actual TV. (And yeah, I know, I can ""cast"" from my computer.)DVR recordings are limited to only 10. That's something I can live with because I'm only recording motorcycle racing on Bein Sports. That said, if I was using Fubo as my primary streaming service, that would be a deal breaker.As for image/video quality, there are no issues. It's on par with all of the other streaming services (aside from Amazon with their AMAZING UHD 4K playback.)I suspect FuboTV will fix their Fire TV app quickly, so I'll probably try them again in a few months.

Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.  But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.  Who designed this thing?  It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.  What?  Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.  Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.  Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.  I've stopped keeping track.Finally, all the so-called HD streams are really at 720p, not 1080p.  There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.  (Yes, drain is the right term.)  I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes.

Robert,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't regret my choice, after the fact.","I find the service good.  This change has reduced my bill substantially.  My bill will be $100.00 less per month all-in (that reduction takes into account that I have added services that I did not previously have - add-ons to FUBO).  I did not have the top of the line cable service from my provider.  Instead I had the third best out of four options from my provider.Is it more complicated than cable TV? Change means adjustment to a different format.  The learning curve is not overwhelming.  For those not well versed with changes in TV services I would recommend getting a younger family members assistance to make the change.  I chose to load FUBO via the Amazon Fire platform.  After the fact I found out that I cannot watch HBO on Amazon's platform.  I can stream it on my iPhone and iPad, as it can be streamed on other devices.  That is inconvenient, but not a deal breaker.  Solution, use the Apple TV platform, the Youtube's platform or I believe ROKU's platform.Note: the number of channels I had access to on cable totaled 220.  On FUBO it is substantially less.  For me this was not a problem, as I complemented what FUBO offers me with HPO and Disney (still I have the stated cost reduction).  I also have Netflix and am an Amazon Prime member, which I had before I left the cable service.  I have more than I have any possibility of ever watching.Best part of this change?

Mr. Doh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother if you have Amazon Fire TV,"Amazon Fire TV implementation is terrible. No entry for ""Settings"" at the top. The navigation between features is much less useful than any other alternative internet TV offering that I've seen. Like when you press the menu button on Playstation Vue, you see the current show, the next couple of shows, and can switch to the Guide if you want. On Fubo, you press the menu button and you can change the video resolution, worthless. They really need to work on navigation for users with Fire TV. About the only thing that you get for live TV are select, the arrow buttons, and return. I assume the Roku is much better, not going to pay $100 to find out, though. The only plus is that the local stations seem to work well. Not the stuttering that I see on Playstation Vue local channel, or all the myriad of problems with the local stations on Hulu with Live TV. But the navigation with Fire TV is so bad, I can't use it.What I'd really like to do is rearrange the guide to put all the sports channels together at the bottom of the guide, instead of having some at the top, and another group at the bottom. Really wacky the way that the channels are arranged. Some are alphabetical like you'd like (the non-sports ones), and the sports channels are just disorganized.But in the end it doesn't matter. Unless I can find another way to use this app without the Fire TV, ain't going to happen.",,Functionality and Features
David A,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some Problems But No Show Stoppers,"I must say from the start that the only reason I purchased this app for to watch the Giro d'Italia (Italy's version of the Tour de France). I use NBC Sports Gold to watch cycling but the Giro was not a covered race. A quick Google search led me to fubotv. I primarily watch TV through FireTV so I downloaded the fubotv app and then subscribed through my computer. I have been using fubotv for less than a week. Based upon that experience I offer the following observations.I am able to watch the Giro as I desired. There are quite a few other channels available but I have not watch any, for reasons to be discussed below. The picture quality is fine and as with all internet apps it is dependent on you internet speed/quality.My biggest disappointment is the limited capacity of the ""DVR"" feature. While it is true you can ""record"" shows for later viewing you are limited to three ""recording"" total. Also, you must watch those recording within 72 hours of there recording, after which they will be deleted. This limitation has prevented me from recording any thing other than the Giro (which is a 21 day race) which explains why I have on experience with other channels. This wouldn't be too bad except the DVR does not provide the ability to record a ""season"". Rather, I have to go the desktop each day and set the DVR to record the next program (in my case, the next race three days in the future). A ""Season"" or ""Record All"" option sure would be nice.Another limitation, at least from the FireTV standpoint, is that you can't set the DVR to record a show from your TV. You can access the DVR to play a recording but to set new recordings you must use a computer. Also, the schedule on the FireTV fubotv app is limited to about 12 hours in the future.Finally, I have noticed that when the app is paused and then resumed there is a lot of buffering time before the show starts again. I don't believe this is a ISP problem as the buffering is much longer than with PBS, NBC Sports Gold, HBO Now or YouTube.Bottom line, I am pleased to be able to watch the Giro ""legally"". The fubotv allows me to do this. The grips above are really are more observations than show stoppers. With that said, to get cycling with the DVR feature I am paying more than $40 per month. I will cancel my subscription after the Giro is done, not because of the app but because I really don't have any interest in the other channels. If fubotv offers some programming that your looking for I would go for it.",,Functionality and Features
Mike,4.0 out of 5 stars,Goodbye Comcast!,"Fubo has lots of channels and gave me the option of adding on the NFL network.

Sometimes they broadcast Fox NFL games in 4k. My TCL struggles with that channel but my Amazon fire tv works fine with Fox NFL 4k. With the Fubo app, I can install it on my iphone and all my apple devices so I can watch tv anywhere.  You can even stream it on a Windows laptop through the website.I did the free week trial before I finally selected Fubo as I didn't know anyone using the service so I was skeptical.

FuboTv has a great selection of channels and it works on the devices I have.  The stream quality has been decent with the limited bandwidth I have (approx. 15mbps) and the picture quality is good most of the time.  I suspect this has more to do with my internet provider than it does the FuboTV service, I will try to update when my speeds get an upgrade in a month or so.

It can be done on cell phone or lap top so it is not a technical issue.This is super painful because some of the video on demand sports contents have more than one hour extra recording before the real game start. I have to wait patiently for > one hour to watch a game. On the bright side, they just added ""Resume"" function recently. Before that if someone accidentally exit the game I would have to wait again. This is very inconsiderate and makes me want to drop.2. No ABC - This is not a blocker because I can switch to antenna to watch NBA, Oscar, etc.3.

I have 200MB internet speed and a pretty good tech environment at home.Windows version is good.I mostly use, if not all the time Amazon Fire TV. Honestly, it looks like it is in beta version at most.Lots of buffering and pixelation. If youÃ¢â¬â¢re based mostly on sports, this is the most important feature. On live games, it worked better streaming on Chromecast from my phone.Stream Quality is not 1080p and 60hz on most of the channelsNot easy to surf the channels. I have to go back to the list to choose another one, when it should be the option to see whatÃ¢â¬â¢s on the other channels while IÃ¢â¬â¢m on the current one.When I go back to the schedule, it defaults to Fox, the very first channel on the list and I have to scroll all way down if I want to go back to where I was previously watching.To make things worse, when I scroll up and down the list and I click the left side of Fire remote, it selects El Rey by default, no matter where I am. By now IÃ¢â¬â¢m completely lost of where I want to go.Close Captioning are horrible. 1 - There is no way to personalize the fonts, background etc. Too big and cover good part of the screen. 2 Ã¢â¬â They have to be selected on each channel and they donÃ¢â¬â¢t stay on when I change them.DVR is not available on Fire TVOn live sports tab, I clicked on Germany Ã¢â¬â Mexico game and something totally different showed upRW & FF donÃ¢â¬â¢t work.So, it needs some workSince there is no remote with numbers and no numbers assigned to channels, should be some kind of grouping, same as you have for sports. Sorting by News, Movies etc, depending on whatÃ¢â¬â¢s on now and the channel type.Internet version on chrome is way better.It should be an option to add favorite channels and to be able to sort them to our preferences.

music man,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad.,"It's not the best or worst app for Fire TV. The app is easy enough to navigate, but nothing great. The picture sometimes pixelates or buffers.My main complaint is the FF/RW options! Why are we limited to 15 second skips? It would be far nicer if we could do a standard FF/RW. If I'm somehow missing how to do so, please let me know.Update: Added a star since you can press the FF/RW button repeatedly to add skip time in increments of 15 seconds. I've done as much as 3 minutes. I don't know if there's a limit. It would still be easier to have a regular FF/RW so I could watch any interesting ads.",,Functionality and Features
Tushster,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best on Fire TV Stick,"I decided to stick with FuboTV after debating between different live TV streaming services, mostly because of their vast channel lineup, as well as being sports-focused (although the lack of ABC and ESPN is quite glaring). I haven't had any issues with the video quality or frequent buffering as some of the other reviewers, but I have noticed that compared to the FuboTV app on the a device like the Roku, the app on the Fire TV Stick is not as intuitive.First of all, it takes a long time to load, not just the app, but even starting up any channels. The circle will spin for a while before streaming finally begins. Another thing I am not too particularly fond of is the rewinding/fast forwarding capability. It's not very streamlined, and you end up going too far backwards or forwards, and have to keep messing around to get to where you want to be. I wish Fubo could implement a thumbnail system like Sling and YouTube TV so you can see exactly where you are in the program when you're rewinding or fast-forwarding. Once you click play, it takes another long time to load.I personally prefer the Fire TV Stick over Roku, but until FuboTV can incorporate a few more features which will help make the service much more streamlined and easy to use, I will use the FuboTV app on the Roku as it is slightly faster and more responsive.",,User Interface and UX

Or right in the middle of a match, the screen seizes up and you miss the rest of the game because the app keeps quitting. That's Fubo. Ive had it almost a year and it has not improved at all.

David P,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good content but unreliable. Constantly retrying to view a channel is not an acceptable experience in 2016.,"I was keen to test Bein Sports on fubo tv and was pretty happy with the coverage of non-football events like F1 racing and rugby. The problem I had with this app is the flakiness of the connection. We have a 75Mb broadband link (cable) which supports all the main on-demand movie channels (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Crackle) with no problem. Live apps like Twitch and CBS work fine, as did SlingTV (which we cancelled due to content rather than quality of experience). But fubo tv is a hit-or-miss experience where you often have to back out and retry 3-4 times before getting a reliable connection. When it finally connects, the quality is great - but the effort needed to get there is frustrating and not up to par for an online streaming service in 2016.

Constantly retrying to view a channel is not an acceptable experience in 2016.,"I was keen to test Bein Sports on fubo tv and was pretty happy with the coverage of non-football events like F1 racing and rugby. The problem I had with this app is the flakiness of the connection. We have a 75Mb broadband link (cable) which supports all the main on-demand movie channels (Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, Crackle) with no problem. Live apps like Twitch and CBS work fine, as did SlingTV (which we cancelled due to content rather than quality of experience). But fubo tv is a hit-or-miss experience where you often have to back out and retry 3-4 times before getting a reliable connection. When it finally connects, the quality is great - but the effort needed to get there is frustrating and not up to par for an online streaming service in 2016.

No Europe, Brazil, Argentina or even Mexico soccer. The DVR function of the app works very well, and as far as I am concerned, is the most interesting feature it provides.

The lack of channels is also a problem for us. I like that they have a few must have channels, but the ones missing hurt badly when nothing you want to watch is on those 3 or 4 channels and like I said before, Recording is too much trouble to even mess with.

The majority of the apps available, including for roku, the worst of them, are very poorly functional. On roku you can only watch live - no access to your DVR, prior games, or even to fast forward or go back. Plain simple live is the ONLY option.If you use chromecast or other way to use the app on a phone or tablet, it is slightly better, but as you cast to tv, the fast forward and all other commands no longer function, unless you stop casting.Then comes the worst part of it - say you recorded a game, or want to watch a game that happened a few hours ago. First, you need phone or app - again, no roku functionality (they have been on beta for over one year). Second, good luck watching it all. The app saves what they think is an average time for the game, and if it is a bit longer, you miss the end.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,PLEASE if you think you canceled read this,"I won't post my entire experience however there is a detailed review on both trustpilot and the BBB.

I canceled after 1 hour and still was put into that loop where you will get replies to emails where the goal may be to run out the clock on the 7 days.2.  VERY IMPORTANT - They will tell you that you have to cancel through the app, and that was easy enough to do. but thank god I didn't hit yes , i confirm I want to cancel, and look away from the screen as it went back to their home page.  A statement that really blended in with everything else and was only on for a second or two said that my cancellation was not successful.  This is where I knew it was a scam.  It should have given me an error when I hit that confirm button and not let me cancel or I should have gotten and email generated by the system stating that my cancellation was not successful and to please contact customer service.  Of course neither thing happened.  I can only imagine how many people have hit that button and looked away, went to a different tab quickly, or just didn't notice the hard to notice or because it was so fast thought it said that their cancellation was, instead was not, successful.If you are reading this before signing up with these people, unlike me, Don't!  Run and don't look back.And if you know you canceled through the app within the 7 days and still got billed, you are not crazy rather you were scammed.If you do cancel through customer service ask for a confirmation email and if you don't have one within 15 minutes call back.

Nina Steven,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pointless - The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.,"It seems Fubo has missed the point of the  cord-cutting ""targeted streaming content service"" trend. Or, at least, they want you to think it's cord cutting. Unlike NFL, NBA and MLB apps that offer the user the ability to focus on just the content they are after (baseball, hockey, US football), Fubo delivers packages of fairly low bandwidth sports streams that force you to channel surf in order to find the content you're looking for. (Let's face it, there are hundreds, if not thousands of football matches going on around the world all year long),The truth is, when you're forced to buy bundled packages that resemble what you are already paying for with traditional ""cable tv"", you've just exchanged one cord for another. For most people, internet and standard cabe tv use the same physical wire to the house. Using Fubo to stream the same channels means you are actually using a SLOWER (lower bandwidth & quality) stream to watch the same channels in lower quality. PLUS you are paying for the additional data/bandwidth usage that goes against your monthly allotment...- And before Fubo says ""but you can watch on computer or mobile device""; most cable providers already offer mobile apps or web access to live channels. Most major networks already offer mobile/web access to streaming content if you can prove you have a traditional cable tv contract. (NBC/ABC/FOX/SKY etc..) - So (MAYBE) Fubo has missed the point on cord cutting and targeted streaming, (MAYBE) Fubo knows but wants people to think it's a cable/cord killer service, or (MAYBE) Fubo is an initiative sponsored by a major cable company to rope former customers into a service that, at it's core, is exactly what people are trying to get away from or already paying for.NOTE to Fubo: The point of targeted steaming apps is to allow customers to pay for ONLY the channels they use. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Mhz, MLB,, Netflix, Amazon Prime all do this very well.. So if Fubo REALLY want to impress customers, they will figure out a way to corral all of the network relationships they've made into apps or options within their app that allow customers to purchase focused content like EPL, Europa League, Bundesliga League, specific team matches or cup competitions without the need to channel surf and slog through irrelevant content to find the content they're seeking. Otherwise, there's really no point. The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.",,Performance and Stability
Byron T.,3.0 out of 5 stars,FuboTV Service is OK and may be Right for you but some Services needs to be improved.,"Note:  I have not used the Amazon App for FobuTV.  This review is for FuboTV service.  I sign up for FuboTV from their website & have only used them for little over 2 weeks now.  I replaced Google TV service with FuboTV due to Google getting out of TV Service & for new customer suggest either YouTubeTV or FuboTV.  I could have kept Google TV Service but if they're not accepting new subscribers, then sooner or later they'll dumb those who have changed off or drive up the price to make you change.  On the plus side I will be saving $$$ by going to FuboTV instead of Google TV, which was part of my decision to switch now instead of when Google makes me.Is FuboTV service right for you?  Maybe I can help.  I really don't like doing review, because my general experience is only 2 type of people normally write a review.  1) Those that are extremely happy with the service & 2) Those that are dissatisfied with the service.  Me, I'm neither extremely happy or dissatisfied, which is why I'm actually doing this review.  I'm a highly Technical Network Administrator for a very large manufacturing company for over 30 years.  I'm the person in our Division of our Company that makes Technology works.  That being said, I know how I would like FuboTV to work/the way it should work.FuboTV Channel vs. it's cost.  This is a decision that each person must decide for them self.  For me, once Disney/ESPN came to FuboTV it had the channel I wanted most.  What I mean by wanted most is, it didn't have everything I wanted but if I got/changed to FuboTV service, I wouldn't be going looking for another service to get any additional stations.  (That wasn't true for any other service that I looked into like:  YouTubeTV, Sling, Philo, or AT&T.  OK, AT&T might also have the channels but didn't like the cost or DVR Service they offer & wouldn't try them because of it.)  YouTubeTV was close but still missing some channels & didn't like the ideal of losing my DVR after 9 months.  Also FuboTV really doesn't have many of mine local stations & from what I can tell unless you live in the top 5 or 10 cities in the US, it probable won't have very many or yours either.  What I did was buy an antenna for about $40 & get about 20+ local stations.What I like about FuboTV:*  Has the channels I wanted/could live with without adding another TV Service provider.*  Price for the channels I get.  (After paying for cable bills & seeing them always going up, glade to have it finally come down some.)*  DVR 30 Hours with option for 500 Hours & you can keep your recording as long as you want them.  (Most review will say that YouTubeTV has the best DRV services.  I don't agree.  I would rather have only 500 Hrs. of DVR & be able to keep shows for the length I want to keep them, then to have Unlimited Recording but lose all recordings after 9 months.  But that's me.)*  Ability to mark channels as Favorites & have them appear on top of the menu.  (You're also able to re-order your Favorites, in case you want to add one to your list & have it move to the top your menu.)*  Profiles - Each family member can have their own Profile*  Different View of the Stations you want (Standard TV Guide or by Network).*  Pause Live TV (it works my not very well)*  Max of 3 concurrent steaming (YouTubeTV allows 4)What I dislike about FuboTV: (Some will be the same as I like but will explain what I dislike about it.)*  Profiles - Yes it's nice to have them but when I replace my cable server with FuboTV service, every time I launch FuboTV, I have to select the Account Profile to use.  It needs the ability per device to set a default Profile it'll auto logon/use.  Once on that device, I can always change if I want another Profile.*  Pause Live TV - Great must have in live TV service but FuboTV Pause just doesn't work all that well.  1)  Once you un-pause & try to skip a commercials you don't have any indication when to stop the skip.  Give me a preview of what I'm skipping, so I know when the commercials are off.  (YouTubeTV give you a preview when skipping the commercials.)  2)  Rewinding Live TV doesn't work if the shows goes off.  If a new TV show has just started 10 seconds ago & you want to rewind to the end of the last show due to walking out of the room of somebody was taking to you, you can't rewind to see it again/catch what you missed, even though it's only been off 10 seconds.  Come on give user 10 to 30 minutes to rewind once a show goes off, in case we want to go back.  3)  If you like to binge-watch live TV, then due to #2 Pause reason above, your in trouble.  I like to pause live tv to 30 to 90 minutes & do something else.  Then come back & watch the station I paused & skip the commercials.  Doing this on FuboTV will cause you to miss something you wanted to see.  Once the show goes off you paused on, you're in trouble.  It will let you finish watching the show you hit pause on but if also want to watch the show that comes on after the show you paused, when I pause, ff, or look at menu, the show stops.  I have to go off the show, then back on it or go to view Live to start watching it at that point in time.  Anything that was paused is now gone.  (This has cause me to miss many things I wanted to watch.)*  Profiles Recording are only available to the Profile that recorded the show.  OK, keeping the who record show per profile separately is not necessarily bad but give me another options to view all profiles recorded show too.  So if I want to watch something my wife/child has recorded I have to log onto their profile to watch it.  Then when I'm done log back onto my profile.  The total DVR recording (either 30 Hrs or 500 Hrs) is shared across all the profiles but not the shows.*  Max of 3 concurrent steaming, needs option to have 4/match YouTubeTV, which allows 4.What I would like to see:  (This list excludes fixing what I dislike, which I think needs to be fixed.)*  Does anybody remember ever using Picture within Picture?  Why not bring it back with Internet Live TV services.  Esp. for a TV service that really boost about all the sports show they have.  Would love to spit my screen have 2 current live Football games going on it & simple selecting the left/right side would change the sound to that game.  (This may just be me but I would love to have the ability to watch 2 live TV Stations at the same time.  Yes it would be smaller on the screen but with 50, 60, 70, 80, 100+ size in screens today, don't really think that would be a big issue.  It wouldn't be for  me.)  I've seen some people mount to TV on the walls to get this function.  (One of the TV is usually smaller then  the other to get this function but this make me think I'm not alone i wanting this feature.)",,Functionality and Features
M. Holderfield,4.0 out of 5 stars,3+ Month Long  Redundant Running Commercials Spoil the FuboTV Experience,Have had FuboTV for 6mos and I have no issues other than a few hiccups on streaming occasional. What they need to fix is their commercial programming. I have contacted them about having to watch & listen to the Dr. Dre Beats headphone commercial at every commercial break since January. The song being played is very annoying and having to hear it every 5 - 10 min is noxious at best. Their tech support weiner replied back quickly but said they have no control over the commercial programming I call B.S. as I checked multiple channels and that obnoxious commercial is being run on all of them. The next new commercial just arrived from Chili's. I won't buy Beat headphones and I won't go to Chili's just because you drive your message at me every 10min.,,Customer Support and Responsiveness
Westerly Guild Man,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good content, just not for me...","After trialing FuboTV for a week I chose to cancel.  The sports content was very good (for international sports), and the content of movies and tv programs was pretty good.  My main complaints were: 1. while I could save or record movies soon to be aired on individual networks, I did not see a way to save those that were on demand, meaning that each time I wanted to watch an on demand movie I would need to do a new search through all movies.  Being able to save movies to a favorites list would have been a very good option.  2. TV programs I liked could be saved, or recorded.  There was then a list created of all of the programs I was following, which was great.  What wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t great was that the list only displayed 20 shows or recordings, which means that after I spent my time going through everything offered on Fubo and saving or recording the content I was interested in, the majority of it was saved, but not searchable as only 20 items were kept in the list.  Very frustrating! Again, good content, but the delivery of that content and the difficulty in identifying something to watch was why I cancelled.Customer service: canceling within the trial period was a challenge, but eventually the monthly charge I incurred as a result of not being able to easily cancel was fully refunded, and I thank Fubo for that.  Unfortunately, it took way too much time, effort, aggravation, and unfortunate negative reviews to make that happen.  After getting the runaround for several days I was finally contacted by a woman who took care of the problem in a matter of seconds.  Had it been a strait forward process from the beginning, and if Fubo cleans up the customer service issues I experienced it would be a very good service for a lot of people, just not for me.",,Customer Support and Responsiveness

After paying $50.00 for a one month subscription, FUBO informed me that the fast forward and fast back feature normally available on any recorded content was not available. This feature is routinely available on sports streaming services and has been available on past streaming services for Le Tour. The feature is especially valuable for an event as long as a day's stage in The Tour. To allow subscribers to sign up with out informing them of the absence of this service is quite simply fraudulent. My subscription fee is non refundable. FUBO is simply streaming NBCSN for this event.

Bill Lewis,1.0 out of 5 stars,The other streaming services are better.,"FuboTV is a disgraceful experience.  I have tried it several times over the last year and it has only gotten worse.  Perhaps you may like it if:1) you enjoy live events streamed to you several minutes after they happen.2) you enjoy FuboTV injecting their own commercials into the stream, played at every commercial break, sometimes more than once in the same break.  When you see the same commercial 50 to 100 times over a couple of hours, your head is ready to explode.3) you like a menu where you have to press a button 20 times or more to find a channel.4) you are a cycling fan and pay extra for Fubo Cycling only to find that it doesn't have a single live event for over 3 months, and repeatedly shows an obscure race in China from last year for the entire 3 months.5) you don't mind an app that crashes repeatedly and has navigation problems that were present several versions ago, fixed, and reappear in subsequent versions.6) you don't mind recording something only to find you have to wait several hours to view it.7) you don't mind being patronized by the 'support' staff.One good thing about FuboTV, it's easy to cancel your subscription.

I am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan and wanted to watch the post season games, but the NHL and stations like NBC will only grant access to the games if customers provide their cable company information. If these stations don't catch on soon, they will get left behind, like newspapers and video rental companies The Internet has changed everything. NBC can either adapt or become irrelevant. More and more people are cutting their cable connections. If NBC wants to have customers, then it needs to grant people access to the games who don't have cable.

When you click open, you get the NBC logo with a spinning yellow circle for approx 1 second, then a message that says:ErrorAn error has occured.Options from that point are cancel or retry.This persists after clearing of cache and data, reinstalling the application, and even resetting the firestick to defaults.When you finally do get through to NBC support, they say they're working with Amazon to find the problem. That's the same thing they told me during the Boxing Day games, December 26th.UPDATE: This app still does not work. 7 months later the exact same error persists across all Amazon Fire TV devices.",,Functionality and Features
Jonathan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Sports,"My only issue with this app is that every time you click on an event, it makes you watch a 30 second ad. This is just a little annoying, especially when you know you are missing stuff. But otherwise, this is a great app. It offers the main sporting events that NBC has, like Sunday Night Football, hockey, etc. Additionally, it offers some unusual sports, like various tournaments (tennis, badminton, Esports, luge) as well as the Olympic and Golf channels. Lastly, it offers highlights, interview, and other short videos. Oh, and replays of full events. Just a note: a lot of unpopular sports do not have commentary or even sound equipment, so don't be thrown off when the World Billiards Tournament Game is silent. Also, you do have to have a corresponding TV subscription.",,Functionality and Features

Bypass your PIHole, remove ad blockers from computer, whatever. That fixes the problem.As for the app, it sucks. The ads are as every 1-star review describes, constant, unrelenting, and repetitive. Hockey games aren't so bad, but the Olympics were terrible.  Needing a subscription is expected, but a cable account is ridiculous. Just give a non-cable cutter friend or family a few bucks and use their account. The app is slow and sluggish. Just have to deal with that.  I would say use every means necessary to circumvent the traditional ""Pay us to watch, watch our advertising, and we'll black out what we want"" mentality of the networks.

Richard Weaver,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE,"NBC sports and sports gold are terrible. It makes you re activate your device through your computer or phone multiple times which is a pain. You get your TV set up, then suddenly in a couple of weeks, you have to re activate.  That requires your computer and signing into NBC sports each time with a special code. And sometimes the announcer is drowned out by the road noise(cycling). The announcing staff is terrific for cycling. One other issue, I only care about one sport which I pay for(cycling) yet I have to continually pick that sport from a drop down of twenty sports even though you have to add them to your package if you want to view them. Another pain. In general I would state that NBC sports is not very consumer friendly.  If you have a problem you email someone and they send you a generic email in return that suggests they didn't read your email very carefully.",,Compatibility and Device Issues
Dr. P. M. Emerson,3.0 out of 5 stars,Monopoly pricing. Mediocre product,"Purchased a Ã¢â¬Ësport passÃ¢â¬â¢ for a competition only screened in the US by NBC SportsGold. With no alternative way of watching my choice was either purchase the pack or not watch the games. Pricing is outrageous for what is screened for free in every other country of the world. The live stream in the six nations rugby I was watching is good (as it comes from the U.K.) but abruptly stops at half time to be replaced by strange wind like noises around the empty stadium. To watch events like the the rugby World Cup in the US you have the choice as a consumer to not watch, or pay monopoly pricing.The APP is best started 10-15 minutes prior to kick off as the security features are apt to have changed requiring swift log-ins on an actual computer (not a phone) to reauthorise what you have already paid for. This is consistent with the monopoly pricing - they donÃ¢â¬â¢t want you sharing log-in details.

I wasn't aware I would be prompted for a review from Amazon for each channel downloaded (or I wouldn't have downloaded 90% of them.)  If there are no previous words to this paragraph and a three star review, then it is obvious I haven't had the time nor inclination to review the channel APP.  I do often review items for seller discounts and therefore I am expected to leave reviews for every item purchased.  The problem here is I didn't purchase any of these channel apps, they were all free for download and use.  I will eventually get around to either reviewing each channel or deleting them from my Amazon fire stick, however when they are deleted from my fire stick the review requests remains.  Due to the fact I am rated on my ability to leave a review for all my Amazon purchases, I must leave this wordy explanation for my review explaining the fact that I wish I had not been prompted for a review on a free channel app.  The Amazon fire stick has been a good little functioning device that allows me to stream conventional shows over my home wifi and internet and although it's not the fastest device (click and wait sometimes) it does function as expected for a small HDMI stick over wifi.

Sindarian,4.0 out of 5 stars,Clunky interface and random commercial insertion during replay events BUT much better than Fox Sport Go,"Clunky interface, random commercial insertion on replay events, poor search interface on replay events, and loading screens are why I will only use this NBC Sports interface if I can't hook up my laptop to the TV for some reason.Also, I really do appreciate the fact that NBC is allowing Olympic viewing on replay but the interface is not very friendly.  Please go back to the interface that was in use for the last Summer games.(EDIT) I have upgraded my rating after looking at the Fox Sports Go app which has no replay of previous events.

JJCEO,3.0 out of 5 stars,It was easy to set up with my digital projector and FireTV stick but the app has some problems!,"I loaded this app onto my Amazon FireTV stick and I am watching Sunday night  NFL football live on a 11 ÃÂ½ foot diagonal screen. The video and sound quality are excellent. Unfortunately when commercials are playing, sometimes NBC blanks the screen with a spinning wheel. The football game does not start playing again when the commercials are over. It forces me to back out of the game and start it again and then the picture is perfect. Doing this though is frustrating. When I opened the app I was asked to log into the provided address and activate the streaming service by entering my device type, the access code shown on the screen and my cable TV provider. I use ATT U-verse as my cable network. I was instantly connected with the message that my service had been activated and I the game that was coming on which was the Sunday Night NFL football game.  Two weeks later is asked me to register with my cable provider again. Why?I am now watching the NFL game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Carolina Panthers. This is a good  app but it has some performance issues. How can the game broadcast be perfect HD quality but NBC doesn't want to show the commercials and it messes up the broadcast.  If this issue was fixed the app would be a 5 star app but as it is I rated it 3 stars. I can watch the game but I have to survive the commercial streaming issues",,Compatibility and Device Issues

Jacob F,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute Garbage App,"NBC could not care less about their streaming app or the people who pay to watch it's content. Words cannot describe my hatred of NBC Sports and this application but I will try, for the people. First off, it is so full of bugs and glitches that it makes for a truly frustrating watching experience. There is no escape, however, as they have you by the balls owning the exclusive rights to some of the best sporting available.  You will have to sign in and verify your credentials to the app so many times, I have nbcsports.com/activate as one of my most visited websites. Once you've gained access to the content you willing pay for it gets even better. There is nothing quite like waking up at 7am eastern standard time to watch some Premier League football only to have the app tell you it is unable to play this asset over and over again. If you are watching a sport that a decent amount of commercial breaks be prepared to have quick cuts to those commercials, so quick in fact that parts of the game will be cut off.  Also be prepared to see the exact same commercials for an entire year/season. You will be reciting the Liberty Mutual ads by heart in no time. Games will lag so far behind normal game time that you have to actively avoid your phone to not see spoilers. To be clear this not an internet speed issue as I pay for decent download/upload speeds.

I use mostly for EPL replays, one, the location of highlights means you have to avert your eyes for spoilers. The titles are often spoilers. Replays should be a the top. Spoiler headings should be eliminated altogether like ""Zlatan puts United ahead."" Just title it ""X v. Y highlights""  The exact same thing plagued the app during the olympics. Not that i care about olympics as this is about the app when it isn't Olympic mode. Sometimes a soccer game will resume where you left off sometimes it doesn't. There is no discernible pattern.A huge problem is often EPL soccer matches are not added to the app in a timely fashion. The game can end and it can be a day or two before it's available. Forcing you to illegal means to get the game shortly after it ends. Worse you can often log on on the phone and see that the game is actually listed for streaming.Note: I have the app on Roku too and it has the exact same issue as the layout is almost identical.Understand this:1.

This renders video chatting with other friends on Skype useless, since they have no contact number with which to reach you.  I tried to delete it twice and reload the application, and even tried the android application.  Nothing I did corrected the problem.  If you don't put the area code in and just have the state, like Texas, it gives you a phone area code for San Antonio, which is 5 hours away.  Someone needs to seriously look at this and make a correction to the app., or give us a way to fix it.  Skype is one of the main video chatting apps that most people use.

Very happy customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Some things to note about the latest Skype version,"I have had a 32GB 8.9 HD kindle since it first came out in late 2012 & some earlier models. If you read through many of the reviews you should notice that most of the 5 star ones were written shortly after the release of the HD series in late 2012 & early 2013. On the other hand, the poor 1 & 2 star reviews were written since late 2013 & later.I would agree with this as it matches my own experience. The original Skype for the Kindle Fire HD series worked very well but an update issued sometime late last year changed all of this. There appears to be two main issues:1. SOUND VOLUME:Even if your volume is set all of the way up before launching Skype, conversations are barely audible. This may be because MS/Skype expect you to use ear buds which is a common way to use the app. If you in fact do this then you will find the audio level to be okay. HOWEVER, if you don't use ear buds then check the volume setting within Skype using the hardware volume switch and you will probably notice that the volume is way down around 25%. If you raise the volume to 100% using the hardware volume control then conversations can be heard okay just like the earlier version and it stays this way in subsequent sessions. They may have made the initial setting this way to prevent ear bud users from blowing out their ears.2. CRASHES:I don't know what to say about this except to confirm that I have had the same experience. Skype starts okay but invariably crashes (frozen screen, no sound, etc.) within 5 minutes and will then the Kindle will spontaneously reboot. This makes what is otherwise an excellent app next to useless.So, this problem has been around for over 6 months without being fixed. Amazon gets a failing grade from me on this issue as they should at least make the original version available for download from their app store for folks having this problem while they are sorting out the issues with the latest version.",Performance and Stability,

Kindle Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Two Stars,It was confusing and I had a hard time following the story,User Interface and UX,
Bonner Sawyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"The 6 month update, tldr = not free, more like ""Bugmeware!!!""","All the things I said before are true. The app works, the price for the ""No Add's"" version is high, to high unless you are using a fire tablet as a primary texting device. The App gets more of a ""PIA"" the longer you use it. Dire warnings that unless you text or call someone in the next ""X number of hours"" you will lose your number ! If This was after 6 months of more I could see it... But the way This App works it's like blackmail to keep your phone number... It became such a pain that I removed the app. This is why I made This edit and dropped my rating from 3 stars to 1Star.  I think the ""Free"" label is false advertising, Free Trial would be closer. If these folks came up with a tiered cost system it could be a workable texting app. But with the $14+ a month price just to use the app without adds or use it or lose it threats, it's not worth it for my use. Why they don't see that  a $20 a year for 250 texts a month or something like that would give them a larger user base and how hard is it to count texts? Software! They have to have This for billing and management anyway.  Look elsewhere if you are just looking for an app to send a text to share a story you found reading the Washington Post with a friend.This App works. It gave me a way to send Text messages from my ""Fire Tablet"" I wanted to be able to share some news articles without having to use email. I have not used the phone call function. What I don't like is the amount of ""Please upgrade!"" Messages... I know they have to pay for the service they provide and make at least some profit from the effort. I normally do buy the ""no adds"" version of any app I use. But the price these guys want is more than what I really use is worth. If you needed the phone call function and if it worked as good as the text function... The the price could be worth it. The only reason I used this app was I didn't want to add Google's play store to my fire, if not for that I would have just used my Google Voice account.",Functionality and Features,

Kyle Heisler,2.0 out of 5 stars,A not so mobile mobile app.,"While the workflows for this app feel better than the PC version of the software, the app is severely limited by it's requirement for an internet connection.  I started using the app at work, which luckily has WiFi, however as my device has no cellular connectivity, I have been unable to use it during my recent travels, nor will I be able to use it to study during the 12+ hours it will take to fly Germany,With the Kindle Fire version of the App, the only apparent need for the internet connection is to sync your progress to the Rosetta Stone servers,  which is useful if you are going back and forth between your PC and mobile device while learning.  However, even this functionality does not work reliably; in my experience the App and PC only synced automatically every third or forth attempt.  While the PC has a force sync option this is not available on the mobile app so you are forced to restart the application through the device settings and hope that your PC synced properly at home.With these issues in mind and the fact that I like to use my Kindle while away from work or home, I wish the Rosetta Stone would have chosen a different method to generate a micro purchase income from their users; such as charging a one time fee to download the App, or charging for some of their more advanced online services.  The fact that I can't use the App as a a true mobile learning platform is endlessly irksome.I also wish that Rosetta stone had built in better orientation support for the app.  I have yet to figure out how the app is determining it's orientation for the session, but more often than not, the app will be incorrectly positioned in relation to how I wish to hold my device.  This is especially troublesome when attempting to use the app while charging the device.TL:DR - While the orientation problems with the app can be annoying, the biggest limiting factor is the requirement for an internet connection.  Which if you are using a device without cellular support effectively makes your mobile device about as portable as your home PC.",Functionality and Features,

I contacted the Rosetta Stone Tech Department regarding this issue back in January and was in contact with someone there throughout the first 3 months of 2014. The issue was resolved in late March 2014 when there was an update on the App that made it work with the new Kindle Fire. I was able to use the app finally and was very happy.

You can push through the lessons quickly on a tablet and the voice recognition on tablets seems to work really well. That's where the good traits end. I spent a lot of money on levels 1-5 (the French desktop application). 3 months of ""online"" access were included. That means in 3 months, I can't use this app anymore unless I pay even more money to access the features and course progress I have already paid for in the desktop version. If you're going to go with Rosetta Stone for learning another language, it's a great program. But don't count on being able to readily use this app. I believe you need another, separate subscription for any other languages you're learning (and have likely already paid for). The subscription is annual, so you will have to resubscribe every year if you plan on taking more than a year to learn the language or just want to brush up on your skills. Unless you're willing to pony up more dough for the subscription or just go with the online access itself and be willing to let that expire at some point, save yourself the trouble and get the desktop version.

Soon the error occurs again, and again I press play and again the hourglass stays on as I watch the program. My bandwidth is variable, but it isn't low. When I test it, I always find my test app sees 10 Mbps on the first run, 20 Mbps on the second, 24 Mbps on the run after that, and about 34 Mbps on a fourth test. So my impression is that my phone company (AT&T) always gives up to 10 Mbps a new stream, and then bumps it up if the demand continues. Also if I try streaming HD video on another devices or if I don't, it makes no difference in the TED app errors, and the video on the other devices works perfectly regardless of whether the TED app is running.  So I conclude the app isn't able to handle changes in throughput, even though all my other devices and apps (with one app exception) work fine.

When I click ""get started"" & choose a language from the long list it goes to a blank white screen (which looks like an Internet screen) it has a circle w/a timer but then it goes back to the main start up screen. It does not allow me to start/create a new account. So I logged on to the Internet & created an account through the website. Then I came back into the app & tried to login using the account that I set up & it still won't let me in. After I put my username/email (tried both ways) & password in, it brings me back to the start up screen just like the getting started process does.",Compatibility and Device Issues,

J. Walsh,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but I expect more from the Food Network,"First, let me say that this is a good product, not great. It marginally improves upon the foodnetwork.com experience on a tablet. It does the basics of allowing you to search for recipes on foodnetwork.com by show as well as save those recipes into a recipe box that are linked to the website. However, the recipe box does not allow you to create folders, only store in folders you create on the website so a little less functionality than the website.A nice (but incomplete) feature allows you to create shopping lists from recipes. However the app does not combine ingredients from multiple recipes so you have a short, concise list. It should also allow you to scale recipes based on the number of servings you would like to make.Likely the biggest complaint is that it has even less video than the website (i.e., no video at all from what I found...) Given that this application is published by the Food NETWORK you would think that they would have lots of video to include.  Also, when shows have multiple recipes that are pared together, there are no links from one recipe to another meaning you have to find it on your own.The app itself runs ok. It did crash once on my Galaxy Note 10. In short, I'd wait for them to put in a serious upgrade until paying the $1.99...",Performance and Stability,

BlessedCP,1.0 out of 5 stars,DOWNGRADED and updated my review,"I had to update my glowing review of this app because of the updates and changes they have made.  It is no longer user-friendly.  The ads, which were noticeable before, but small, are now annoying and often blocking area I want to read or edit. I absolutely love this app.  I have never had an app device before so I am new to this.  Because of frequent updates I lost my recipes numerous times.  They now have a subscription fee where you pay for a monthly or yearly subscription that expires, it is not cheap.  I would prefer to buy the app outright, that is not an option.I have since deleted this app from my device and found a different one.  I was SO, SO sad to let this one go.  It was my most used and favorite app on my Fire.Former review:  I cook differently than a lot of people focusing on healthy, fresh foods without the use of canned goods or processed foods.  These types of recipes are difficult to find in standard cookbooks and cooking sites.  But with Chef Tap I can read my favorite healthy cooking blog and instantly transport the recipe into Chef Tap, it is easy, painless and fast.  Editing is easy as there is an option to view the whole blog post and import any text that didn't make it into the recipe.You create your own tags and then you can add those tags to any recipe.  So I have my breakfast tag, beverage, salad, etc.  The recipes are searchable by its tag, but also by a title word.You can also add your own personal notes to any recipe which is a great way to make note of changes you made or even when it was prepared.I do have some wishes for the program:  I wish it did weekly menu planning including breakfasts.  I would also appreciate a generated shopping list.  And more than any other function I wish it could sync with a computer version and even a phone version.  I would LOVE this program on my browser.  Then I could STORE the recipes on my computer, but then access them from the Fire when I am in the kitchen.One of my biggest complaints is that the back-ups take a long time once you have several recipes in the program.  Additionally, the back-up runs automatically when you open the program so you can not access your recipes until it is finished backing up.  I would rather the back-up function operated in the background or even when the program isn't being used.  You can amend how you want the back-ups done and how frequently, which is helpful.My other complaint is that when you are making edits in your recipe you can't stay in an edit mode and have to click your options and start over for each step you edit.Overall it is the best recipe import program I have used including my experience with computer versions.",User Interface and UX,
Cybele A. Baker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Down grading for changes to a paid subscription,"You can see my original review below this update.: what was once 4-5 star app has become a 2 star due to the change over to VERY expensive paid subscription if you want to have more than 100 recipes stored. Eleven to twelve dollars a year is ridiculous, I understand they need to make some money to be able to continue to improve and support this app but the cost is prohibitive to what this app does and I refuse to pay them their current fee just to store and import recipes from the internet. And I do not buy their excuse that there is no way they can afford to keep this app running without such a high cost. They do not need servers to store all our recipes, those get stored on our devices and do not cost them a dime. Yes they want to be able to fix bugs and make improvements but please do not insult my intelligence by saying they cannot afford to do it without having everyone shell out for their price. I have far more sophisticated apps on my devices that were free. Yes many of them are supported by larger companies but this program does not require as much tinkering at say a spreadsheet or WORD document writing apps. I might consider an annual fee that actually was fair(at least a 50% cut on their current fee would be smart.) but until that time I won't be upgrading and will just go back to how I used to do it with Pintrest.To sum up; in my opinion while this is a very nice app but it is not worth the price tag they set to upgrade to the ""pro"" version.Original 4 star review:I love this app it works very smoothly 80% of the time...I downloaded all my saved Pintrest recipes with very little corrections needed and adding new stuff is a snap. Where it loses a star is downloading from personal blogs like Blogger etc..I had to pretty much retype most of each recipe myself. Now some of this is probably due to the nature of my blog which has a lot of non recipe storytelling stuff mixed into my entries. But what bothered me was the random stuff this app did not load at all. I would rather it loaded my entire blog letting me delete what I did not want than for it to pick and choose what it wanted to collect.",Compatibility and Device Issues,

Melissa J. Newman,1.0 out of 5 stars,"wanted to like this product, not for $15.99/year subscription fee","The customer service is horrible.  At first I thought the customer service was horrible, because I was not a paying customer.  So I decided to pay for a year to test out the product.  My youngest son wants to be a chef when he grows up, so I really wanted a great recipe tool.  So I paid my money, and reported the software bugs to the developer.  The programmer's bug fix completed trashed my database.  Images on my tablet were deleted, and all changes that I did to recipes on my tablet were erased.  I import recipes and then modify all of them to suit my family's needs.  Anyway, the programmer's response when I told him my database was trashed was to give me my money back (which I did not ask for), and to downgrade my account from a pro version (which I legitimately paid for) to a basic version (again, which I did not ask for).  Yes, once my database was trashed, I knew that I would never renew the subscription to this product.  But now I have to do it before I hit 100 recipes instead of having a year to find the right product.This product have too many bugs that can serious damage your database of recipes.  It is not worth the price, especially when the programmer wants you have to have a 20+ year relationship with his product.  Over 10 years, that is $156.  Over 20 years, it is over $300 for a simple database to store recipes.  After you reach 100 recipes in the database, you have to pay a yearly subscription fee of $15.99/year.  That is $156.00 over 10 years and over $300 over 20 years.The only software that I re-buy each year is tax software.  Everything else I pay for with a one-time fee, and I will upgrade when I believe that I need to upgrade.  If I need to synch my database on a cloud, I will do it on my own cloud.  I don't need or want to pay a yearly fee for each type of data I may want to back up on a cloud.I believe that programmers should get paid for software they develop, which is why when there is a paid version and a free version of a product for a tablet, I usually buy the paid version.

carrie s daly,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work as a means of mirroring an iOS device to a FireStick,"March 3, 2020I was looking for an app that would allow me to display photos/home videos etc. from my iPhone & iPad to a non-smartTV via my Amazon FireStick.  This app supposedly does that using the Apple AirPlay protocol built in to the newest Apple mobile devices.  I downloaded the AirScreen app onto the FireStick from the Amazon website and installed it on the FireStick according to the instructions.  According to the pre-loaded tutorial video bundled with the app, I should then have been able to go to any iOS mobile device with AirPlay enabled and from the ControlCenter, scan for other Airplay compatible device connected to the same WiFi network (which the FireStick was) and select that device and begin mirroring.  Unfortunately the app was unable to detect either my iPhone or my iPad although both had AirPlay enabled and both were connected to the same WiFi network.I then called Amazon Tech Support and spent about an hour on the line with them while they logged in to remotely view my FireStick screen and operate it remotely.  The were unable to solve the issue so the called Apple Support, making it a 3-Way conference call.  The Apple support rep remotely logged on to my iPad and operated it remotely.  Again, no one was able to make the iPad connect with the FireStick.  Since I had already tried and had the same problem with an AirPLay enabled iPhone also, it seemed unlikely to me and to the Apple rep that both iOS devices were malfunctioning but rather that it was either the FireStick and/or the app itself that was the problem.  The Apple rep came to the same conclusion, so she departed from the conference call.The Amazon rep remained on the line and we did some further checks to determine if there were any other problems with the FireStick itself, which there were not.  Every other non-AirScreen related function of the FireStick appeared to be working normally so we all concluded that there must be a problem with the app itself.I had downloaded the free/demo version of the app, which claims to function fully without upgrading to the paid version, but with advertising pop-ups.  I was not going to pay to upgrade until i saw the app work as advertised, which had it done so, I would then have paid to upgrade to the ad-free version.  Accordingly I do not know if the upgraded version would have worked properly or not.In short, this app does not do what it claims to do and therefore should be considered useless for the purpose of mirroring an iOS device to a FireTV device.",Functionality and Features,

Judebert,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Unreliable, distressing, use better alternatives","Recommendation: Use AirReceiver insteadPicture is acceptable, but delayed by several seconds. Keeps warning me that my network is slow. Disconnects after 15 minutes or so to show an ad, requiring a reconnect from the projecting computer and occasionally restarting the app. Ad display is unreliable, in which case it asks you to purchase *a subscription* and waits for 15 seconds.The ad tries to guilt you into a purchase by claiming expensive server requirements. But Miracast is a Wi-Fi Direct connection, and AirPlay and Google Cast go straight to the display... so the servers are either collecting your data or serving ads. Either way it's a ridiculous cost.  (Possibly they're saving the ""recordings""? I don't want that.)We used AirReceiver and Chrome Cast's ""desktop"" source.

A CBS update may have fixed this original problem,"Update: 9-10-2017Well the latest app update removed the ability to watch a live NFL game on my digital projector. Dear CBS, you are going the wrong way. I pay for full cable TV and yet I can't stream a live game of my home team. My rating has gone from a 1 star to a 4 star and now back to a 1 star.Like many of these streaming apps they are tending to get worse rather than better in what they offer and in performance.Update:When I first got this app I tried for over a month to watch multiple sporting events and I could not stream any live sporting events. My primary interest was to watch the NFL games on CBS. Today I was in the basement working and I turned on the digital projector and the CBS Sports app and the NFL AFC playoff game was on line between the Patriots and the Pittsburg Steelers. It was streaming perfectly in HD quality with no issues. I have raised my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.I hope CBS keeps streaming live sports like this. This will make this app much more useful with my Amazon Fire TV stick. Many of the people that gave this app a poor rating should try to see if it is working now.  Thanks CBS for fixing this issue.----------------Original review:I have full cable service and I use multiple apps to play TV channel programs live on a wide screen projector in our entertainment room. Many of the apps for TV channels allow me to sign in and prove that I am a customer of a TV provider, like ATT U-verse, and it automatically lets my watch live video on the projector wirelessly. I use a Fire TV Stick to do this. This app will not let you watch live TV at all. For my purposes of watching an NFL game I find this app useless for my application.I find it amazing that so many other national channels allow you to stream live video for free once you register that you are paying for cable TV, but not CBS!  It shows a lot of bits and pieces of talk shows about sports that I don't  care about. This app for me is a 1 star and I would rate it lower if I could. CBS needs to catch up with its competitors and show live TV. ESPN, TNT, FOX, NBC, Disney, and ABC do it properly and there are other stations that also stream live TV. CBS needs to wake up and realize that this is 2016 and a digital world and not 1950!-------------So far the app is still working reasonably well.",Compatibility and Device Issues,

On the Fire TV devices it's a horribly useless app where you can only stream seemingly random clips from different shows, but no live streaming.

Blue11,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It has stereo audio only, like it's 1975 or something.","I got this for both my AppleTV4K and my Amazon Fire Stick 4K to see the Super Bowl in higher rez (1080p/60) with less compression than the overly compressed 720p garbage Spectrum Cable spews out. For whatever reason, it didn't work worth a damn on the Fire (unless you consider sub-VHS quality and constant freezing to be OK), and on the AppleTV4K, where it looked fantastic, it went less than 15 minutes before it crashed. I suspect the servers had far more traffic than Fox and whomever they hired to do the streaming expected.However, the MAJOR disappointment was that the audio on both hardware platforms was 2 channel stereo. Despite the highly compressed video performance, at least Spectrum had decent 5.1 surround audio. I wound up just watching on Spectrum Cable.I would not have even written this review except that I noticed the stereo audio a few days before the big show, and contacted Fox Sports tech support to ask why, and they couldn't make up their minds while I was on the phone whether to just be condescending, or condescending AND rude. As a television engineer (now retired) for 45 years who knows exactly what he's talking about, it was like dealing with the DMV without the warmth you get from the DMV.Seriously, Fox Sports, hire some competent support people and then train them to be less snarky, especially when someone calls to ask why the outfit handling the Super Bowl stream is only capable of two channel stereo.

Matt Wolfgang,1.0 out of 5 stars,This app made me hate using my FireTV Stick!,"Massively frustrating! The screenshot in the Amazon App Store should be a gif of turquoise circle spinning!

Sometimes, if you wait for a minute or two, it will eventually start playing again for another 30 seconds, and then freezes again.In my experience, this is the WORST streaming app from any cable channel or broadcast network. I have such a negative attitude towards this app that it's bled over to my feelings about my FireTV Stick. Since the NBA season started this year, I've been using my FireTV Stick less and less and using my Roku more. Now, I almost never use my FireTV Stick. The only time try to use it when I try to watch the Mavericks play.  I noticed that I was using the Roku almost exclusively a while back, but I couldn't really figure out why.

I think there was an issue with my browser, but the cancellation didn't go through for some reason.  Anyway, I was charged $39.99.  I noticed the day after the charge, contacted customer service and asked if I could get a refund explaining the situation (and the fact I was strapped for cash this month).  They told me no, which I can understand due to the agreement, but it is still frustrating considering I will not be using the service at all in the time I'm paying and I haven't used it since the second day of the trial.  I had this situation once before with Hulu, and they quickly refunded me and I subscribed again once I could afford the payments (yay Hulu!).  They earned a customer for life by doing that.  I think Fubo could learn from that example, honestly.Recommendation: Sling TV offers a better bang for your buck (that's the service I decided to go with since it's less expensive and offers the channels I want).  I had considered going back to Fubo in October, but now it's for sure no.",Customer Support and Responsiveness,
jimbaround02,2.0 out of 5 stars,Frequent channel buffering and pixelated video,"I was pretty excited when I first tried Fubo TV.  They have a wide selection of channels including the local sports channels I no longer have with my limited cable lineup.  Unfortunately, during my free trial period I experienced a lot of problems with the video being pixelated.  I thought it was just one channel, so I switched to the Weather Channel.  It worked well for a while, but then began to do the same thing.  This issue occurred while at my vacation house.  When I got home I installed the app on my Amazon TV.  There were no pixelation issues but no matter what channel I watch, at some point the video freezes and buffers.  This some times only occurs for a few seconds and other times I have to close and re-open the app.  It's too bad this channel doesn't appear ready for Prime Time.  I was looking forward to consolidating my video on Fubo and getting rid of Hulu and Sling.  Looks like at the end of the month I'll be getting rid of Fubo.",Performance and Stability,
michael w,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible app and service,"Terrible app and service.  The only one I have ever experienced that was worse was SlingTV.  Both buffer constantly, freeze, and require reboots often.  I ordered this to watch NBC Sports Network so I was seeing all the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Don't count on watching your favorite competition without lots of interruptions.  I literally couldn't watch a single Luge run (all under one minute runs) without it buffering at least once if not more often.That's truly pathetic.  We have a stable and speedy connection and have no issues with amazon prime, netflix, youtube, and a myriad of other streaming types of content.If you're looking for a streaming service app, this one is a real drag.

James Altemus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Random commercials on certain channels are a feature, not a bug","We switched to fuboTV from another streaming service because the other service dropped a key channel for us. The service works well enough, though for a live sports-focused streaming service, the lack of anything ESPN and the lack of alternate/back channel functionality on the remote are curious choices, but something we've adapted to.What really bothers me about fuboTV is their ad delivery. fuboTV has figured out a way to insert ad breaks into live events like soccer, which are generally broadcast without commercial interruption. My issue is that they are using this technology on channels that run pre-recorded programming that already includes commercial breaks. For example, when my kids are watching a show Cartoon Network or Nick/Nick Jr., in the middle of a show segment an block of one or two ads for products not targeted to children (Geico, Red Lobster, etc.) will pop up. The show returns when the ads are complete, but since the technology doesn't pause the underlying program, part of it is lost. Keep in mind that this is in addition to the pre-set commercial breaks in the programs where they will sometime insert local or regional spots over the national spots. I've contacted fuboTV about this issue on a couple of occasions, and while they seem responsive and it does stop for a while, eventually it starts up again. At this point I'm convinced that this is by design.Fix these things and I'll stick with fuboTV. Otherwise, I'm waiting for YouTube TV to be available on FireTV so I can switch.",Functionality and Features,

I dont get it ! The slingTV is great, DirecTV is great, Hulu Live is OK. If you are listening Fubo, you need to look at how others setup their UI. Yours is so poor, I will probably not continue past the trial. There is no realtime guide onscreen during a broadcast, you hit the back button you go to a guide at the first listed channel, so you have to scroll down again and again. It buffers but no more than Direct TV and Hulu (Sling did not). I would love to use fubo but the interface was written by someone who obviously does not use it.I would rather pay more for a UI that you can navigate than this. It looks like a third grader wrote the Fire TV interface. You can not change channels without going back. When you go back it defaults to the first channel in the list. It is beyond annoying.

Bob Emmerich,2.0 out of 5 stars,One of the worst functioning Fire Tv Stick apps,"I'm doing a free 7 day trial of FuboTV on the Amazon Fire Stick I've had for about a year now. I've tried a lot of streaming apps but this one just won't stream without difficulties.  My WiFi router is a few feet away and Fast.com says I get about 35-40Mbps, and everything else I watch works fine, but I can't get Fubo to go more than a few minutes. When I Was watching Dr. Who live Saturday night it woudln't go more than a minute w/o freezing, stuttering, dropping to SD, having the sound go but the picture freeze. My wife thought maybe it was just b/c Dr. Who was live streaming, so tonight we tried DC Legends of Tomorrow from a few weeks ago. It worked much better than Dr. Who, but about halfway through the screen went black but the sound kept going. Then everything stopped. Then it jumped back a bit. Just awful. I'd blame it on the WiFi or Fire Stick but really over a year of so many other services I've never had any problems like this.One thing which did work for awhile was hitting the Options button and changing the resolution to 480p from Auto in the drop down box. It didn't look very good but at least it played after that.I'll be stopping Fubo after the free trial and going back to watching The CW shows for free on The CW app. It has commercials, but it works like it should.If you want live streaming but don't need The CW channel PS Vue seems to be the best service out there right now.

Ultimately, we discontinued use of FuboTV for one reason. Each game or event has a specific amount of time. Until the program starts, you can't select it. When the time ends, REGARDLESS of whether your sporting event is finished, the stream stops. Period. No saved recording, no continued watching, it's just done.We switched to YouTubeTV and found we had none of the same issues. Sport options are severely diminished, but if you're looking for something that will stream all major football games, YouTubeTV is the way to go.If you're into Soccer/Cycling/F1 Racing/etc, Fubo is way better for you, but may result in missing the last parts of a game.",Functionality and Features,

Yes, they have some sports coverage that's hard to get elsewhere.  But it's not worth it.Firstly the user interface is really really bad.  Who designed this thing?  It's clunky, allows very little customization, gives limited information about shows, makes it difficult to change channels, etc. etc.Then you find that it takes some time after you switch to a new channel to get a non-blurry picture.  What?  Are you running this out of your basement, Fubo?And every so often there's an outage.  Unexplained and usually unreported, but there you go, you can't get that stream now.  Has happened to me more than once, and usually right when there was a ""I don't want to miss this"" event.

There's one ""experimental"" 4K channel, rarely has anything on it.Yeah, I've already cancelled my service, just waiting for the current sub to drain.  (Yes, drain is the right term.)  I'm considering Hulu -- it has most of the channels I want, and works well with Fire boxes.

Mr. Doh,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother if you have Amazon Fire TV,"Amazon Fire TV implementation is terrible. No entry for ""Settings"" at the top.

On Fubo, you press the menu button and you can change the video resolution, worthless. They really need to work on navigation for users with Fire TV. About the only thing that you get for live TV are select, the arrow buttons, and return. I assume the Roku is much better, not going to pay $100 to find out, though. The only plus is that the local stations seem to work well. Not the stuttering that I see on Playstation Vue local channel, or all the myriad of problems with the local stations on Hulu with Live TV. But the navigation with Fire TV is so bad, I can't use it.What I'd really like to do is rearrange the guide to put all the sports channels together at the bottom of the guide, instead of having some at the top, and another group at the bottom.

On roku you can only watch live - no access to your DVR, prior games, or even to fast forward or go back. Plain simple live is the ONLY option.If you use chromecast or other way to use the app on a phone or tablet, it is slightly better, but as you cast to tv, the fast forward and all other commands no longer function, unless you stop casting.Then comes the worst part of it - say you recorded a game, or want to watch a game that happened a few hours ago. First, you need phone or app - again, no roku functionality (they have been on beta for over one year). Second, good luck watching it all. The app saves what they think is an average time for the game, and if it is a bit longer, you miss the end.

I canceled after 1 hour and still was put into that loop where you will get replies to emails where the goal may be to run out the clock on the 7 days.2.  VERY IMPORTANT - They will tell you that you have to cancel through the app, and that was easy enough to do. but thank god I didn't hit yes , i confirm I want to cancel, and look away from the screen as it went back to their home page.  A statement that really blended in with everything else and was only on for a second or two said that my cancellation was not successful.  This is where I knew it was a scam.  It should have given me an error when I hit that confirm button and not let me cancel or I should have gotten and email generated by the system stating that my cancellation was not successful and to please contact customer service.  Of course neither thing happened.  I can only imagine how many people have hit that button and looked away, went to a different tab quickly, or just didn't notice the hard to notice or because it was so fast thought it said that their cancellation was, instead was not, successful.If you are reading this before signing up with these people, unlike me, Don't!  Run and don't look back.And if you know you canceled through the app within the 7 days and still got billed, you are not crazy rather you were scammed.If you do cancel through customer service ask for a confirmation email and if you don't have one within 15 minutes call back.

Nina Steven,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pointless - The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.,"It seems Fubo has missed the point of the  cord-cutting ""targeted streaming content service"" trend. Or, at least, they want you to think it's cord cutting. Unlike NFL, NBA and MLB apps that offer the user the ability to focus on just the content they are after (baseball, hockey, US football), Fubo delivers packages of fairly low bandwidth sports streams that force you to channel surf in order to find the content you're looking for. (Let's face it, there are hundreds, if not thousands of football matches going on around the world all year long),The truth is, when you're forced to buy bundled packages that resemble what you are already paying for with traditional ""cable tv"", you've just exchanged one cord for another. For most people, internet and standard cabe tv use the same physical wire to the house. Using Fubo to stream the same channels means you are actually using a SLOWER (lower bandwidth & quality) stream to watch the same channels in lower quality. PLUS you are paying for the additional data/bandwidth usage that goes against your monthly allotment...- And before Fubo says ""but you can watch on computer or mobile device""; most cable providers already offer mobile apps or web access to live channels. Most major networks already offer mobile/web access to streaming content if you can prove you have a traditional cable tv contract. (NBC/ABC/FOX/SKY etc..) - So (MAYBE) Fubo has missed the point on cord cutting and targeted streaming, (MAYBE) Fubo knows but wants people to think it's a cable/cord killer service, or (MAYBE) Fubo is an initiative sponsored by a major cable company to rope former customers into a service that, at it's core, is exactly what people are trying to get away from or already paying for.NOTE to Fubo: The point of targeted steaming apps is to allow customers to pay for ONLY the channels they use. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Mhz, MLB,, Netflix, Amazon Prime all do this very well.. So if Fubo REALLY want to impress customers, they will figure out a way to corral all of the network relationships they've made into apps or options within their app that allow customers to purchase focused content like EPL, Europa League, Bundesliga League, specific team matches or cup competitions without the need to channel surf and slog through irrelevant content to find the content they're seeking. Otherwise, there's really no point. The content is available elsewhere. Sometimes for free.",Performance and Stability,

When you see the same commercial 50 to 100 times over a couple of hours, your head is ready to explode.3) you like a menu where you have to press a button 20 times or more to find a channel.4) you are a cycling fan and pay extra for Fubo Cycling only to find that it doesn't have a single live event for over 3 months, and repeatedly shows an obscure race in China from last year for the entire 3 months.5) you don't mind an app that crashes repeatedly and has navigation problems that were present several versions ago, fixed, and reappear in subsequent versions.6) you don't mind recording something only to find you have to wait several hours to view it.7) you don't mind being patronized by the 'support' staff.One good thing about FuboTV, it's easy to cancel your subscription.

If these stations don't catch on soon, they will get left behind, like newspapers and video rental companies The Internet has changed everything. NBC can either adapt or become irrelevant.

Sproink,1.0 out of 5 stars,I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance,"I've rated this app poorly mostly due to terrible streaming performance. How I came to use this app and my experience is as follows: I recently gave traditional cable the boot and have been using PlayStation VUE for TV service. The most recent NASCAR race was not available on the NBCSN channel but was available through this app. I was curious how well this app would work for a live sporting event and decided to give it a shot. I searched for the app via Fire TV's universal search and was able to find it with ease. Upon installation you have to go through an activation process that requires you to prove you have a cable, or similar, provider; this is not unlike many other pay tv channel applications. Once I completed activation, via a computer, the app was instantly accessible. The interface is sparse yet straightforward and I was able to quickly find the race and stream it. Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine. I was excited to give this application a try, but don't see it as a viable option for watching live content at this point.

Forces you to constantly see and deal with sports you don't care about. No way to hide. Video clips only with no easy way to search or organize. Consise information about your sport? Forget about it. Could've been so much more...,User Interface and UX,
JJohns,1.0 out of 5 stars,UPDATED 10/27/2017  App has been turned into a disaster,"10/27/2017 Installed latest version to see if it makes any difference. The new version obliterated any hope for a better app. Gone is a simple categorization of sport. Now you have to search through 80+ replays all thrown together. Soccer next to football next to racing...who's the idiot who thinks this is better?It's now choppier than ever. I've cleared cache, deleted apps, restart my firetv numerous times, rebooted my router, even turned off every device on our network and still cuts out 1 second of every 8 to 10 seconds of  replay broadcast.  AWFUL!10/23/16: an hour later, while the USGP Race was on, I had come back inside to watch something else, and as the screen refreshed...there it was...So I watched the second half of the race live...will need to go back and watch the start later.10/23/16:  Today, the day of the USGP F1, the app now doesn't have the Live Event for today's USGP nor does it have the replay of Qualifying (watched it live yesterday).  Not sure what goes on behind the scenes, but this has been the trend all year...we on the viewer side call it annoying/flaky/unreliable...among our colorful turretic episodes...This App is awesome!  Replay live events you missed, Great extra insight presentations!  This is awesome!Old Post @900 am 06/17/2016...rated 1 star at the time...they fixed within 6 hours!:Liked this app until near two weeks ago.  F1 episodes that are broadcast on television do not play.  Error message 'Parental Controls prohibit this from being viewed'...I have verified there are no Parental Setting on by FireStick.  Spoke with Amazon Tech Support...they verified it was not a credential issue. Episodes that are Practice 1 & 3 play fine...Practice 2, Qualifying, and the Race itself (even re-broadcast...and live events) do not play.  HEY NBC Sports...is this tied to a rating on the broadcast at all???  Is there some category, G, PG, NR, etc that is not being applied...anything of value (and what the sponsors want us to see) are not able to be viewed.",Compatibility and Device Issues,

Was trying to use this to watch the Olympics, but the interface is really not good; a lot of events are labeled as ""live,"" but then when you click on them you get a ""slate"" (TV jargon) about the event being over; every item you can select starts with a commercial, and then you watch the commercial and end up with a finished event or, often enough, video playback issues that require you to restart it (getting the commercial again) and then getting another fail.  Then there's the titles they were choose.... instead of X vs Y in SPORT as the title, they'd spoil it by saying X defeats Y in SPORT.  The only reason to get this app is because you have no other choices.It worked, and it's not terrible.  We watched the olympic opening ceremony last night; the video quality was generally very good, but there were occasional quality drops, and after some time we'd lose the stream entirely, causing us to go back to the home screen and re-select the video feed; it seems to always start off with a commercial - so you're missing content while you re-acquire the stream.This happened after a couple of hours, so I figured if it would stream that long without a glitch, then it's acceptable - but then it started happening more frequently.

It is very sad to watch.I bought my first Kindle (the generation 3) in late 2010 and immediately fell in love with it. I loaded it up with AmazonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s E-books. It was only black and white with limited internet capability but it was a great device. I really liked the chicklet style keyboard. I still have that first kindle today and it is still working. What a fun device!  On the 28th of September 2011, I upgraded to the new Kindle Fire Full Color 7ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ with Multi-touch display and Wi-Fi. This gave me greater connectivity to the internet and the books were slightly easier to read. Finally, in 2013 I ordered the latest Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) which had better contrast and an 8.9ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ screen. Amazon also claimed that it had 15% faster page loads. It has a 167 PPI display and was the lightest Kindle at 5.98 ounces until 2016's Kindle Oasis. This is the one that became my companion. This is the one that is dying at three years old, a mere child. We will get to the culprit who I accuse of committing this slow, painful and tortuous death in just a minute.On the 14th of December this year Amazon sent out an update Fire OS 5.3.2.1. This free software update added the Amazon ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app plus some other general improvements and performance enhancements. Well, since I hadnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t ordered the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app, just before Christmas (22 December 2016), I decided to uninstall the app. My Kindle Fire, which had been operating beautifully in all modes before, now began to display some quirkiness. Just minor annoyances at first: a very slight delay when calling up a book, the battery recharging at a bit slower speed, auto-connect to my Wi-Fi was intermittent, and my Tumblr App was failing to load pictures. Then I made my first mistake (that day). In order to uninstall the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app I went through the normal ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ procedure and found that I could not uninstall or delete the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. I decided I needed a stronger uninstaller and went on the Amazon web site and downloaded an ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. When that didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t work I decided that perhaps I needed a virus checker and malware cleaner. So I went back to the Amazon web site and ordered Malware and Virus Cleaner for Fire devices (OxCleaner) as soon as I ran this one it showed I had several pieces of Malware, Megabytes of trash, and 97 virus errors on my Kindle. For just $4.49 -- it recommended that I down load another app Malware and Virus Cleaner to actually clean up my Kindle. Yet another app Optimizer & Trash Cleaner Tool for Kindle Fire Tablets was also recommended to clean the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtrashÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ as well as the viruses. Like a fool, I bit on this deal and downloaded the $4.49 program. I ran it and within seconds it came back to inform me that everything was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhunky doryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ my Kindle was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood to goÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. Suddenly, I noticed my Kindle battery was draining much faster than usual but besides that everything seemed okay. Just to make sure I performed a 40 second off/on switch reset to give my Kindle a fresh start.Shortly after this I noticed that one of my books did not open and I called an Amazon Customer service representative. Julius D. was extremely helpful and very patient with me and we spent nearly an hour on the phone as he guided me through several attempts to fix my Kindle. The only area he seemed unfamiliar with was what the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was and how to uninstall it. Outside of that he took me through nearly every procedure possible to fix the device except a total factory reset. After that I contacted two other customer representatives who were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how to get rid of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. It was then that my Kindle began to die. In its death throes it constantly threw up black screens; it seemed to take forever to go from one screen to the next and often just went to black screen; the battery would drain in a matter of minutes and recharging took hours; I had to re-download books that had been there before, it began struggling to open a book and my little kindle just went to a white or black screen. (Choke!) In spite of all the problems I began experiencing with other programs, the persistent ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app just stayed where it was and it would open intermittently. I began to conclude that the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was the culprit that was killing my kindle.

This was the first time since I had signed in to Amazon since 1994 that their customer-centric commitment failed. It had failed totally and now my faithful companion, my Kindle, was dying a slow and excruciating death. It had taken the poison pill and there was no antidote.

RSM61,1.0 out of 5 stars,Locks up Kindle Fire!!!,"This app started locking up my Kindle Fire so bad I had to do a hard reset, plug/unplug the power cable, then do another hard reset again just to get my Kindle to unlock and come back on. After contacting the developer multiple times, I realised he just didn't care. I have two other relatives who had the same problem, so I know it isn't just my Kindle. Actually, I have three Kindles, so that's a total of FIVE so far it won't work on. This app is a total loss, renders my Kindle unusable, and the developer is one of the worst I've dealt with on Amazon. He won't even respond to my requests for help anymore. I finally had to uninstall this app and bought ""Ip cam viewer"" (full) and found no problems so far with that one. Take my advice, if you have a Kindle Fire, stay away from this app. I do have to add this, the app does work well on my Nexus 7 tablet, but it does NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE DEVICES. If you have another kind of tablet, it is a hit or miss, try the free version first. Better yet, if you have IP cameras and want to be able to choose from a list of good monitoring apps that work, don't buy a Kindle in the first place. Buy something else that will allow purchases from the Google Playstore. There is a better selection and most likely your device will be compatible with this app. Good luck.",Compatibility and Device Issues,

No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

BuyItOnce,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW+ decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them.",Performance and Stability,

And they only carry the locally covered NHL games so if you are a hockey fan, this is a terrible option.  Ultimately, this service drove me nuts and was extremely more frustration than an actual ""service"".  The only benefit it had over some other services (ie. Youtube TV) is that they are actual recordings that you can fast forward and skip commercials (as long as it doesn't crash the interface which happens regularly).  Otherwise, trying to figure out how to run the interface was and still is a complete nightmare.  At least on an LG smart TV.  I have to scroll up to get to a menu 6 or 7 times before it actually does it.  The UI is completely unintuitive and a nightmare to figure out.

All of the screens in the application were in Spanish and since I don't speak Spanish I had no idea what I was clicking. There was no setting to change the language.

The Froggie Family,1.0 out of 5 stars,Atrocious business practice,"An extremely lacking streaming service, buffering even when I have 1gig internet and was running Ethernet from my modem to Chromecast. Canceled my ""trial"" due to the awful interface and having games randomly cut off during the last 8 minutes. In live sports, those are moments you'll never get back and paying 70 a month for garbage like that is tragic. Needless to say Fubo wasn't done with me there. They decided to reactive my account with my permission 3 month later and just start billing me a fluctuating price form 65-75 a month. Sadly it took me 5 month to notice due to a high tempo life in the military. Once I reached out and asked for an explanation their original response was pretty much. ""well our system created a second account and it's been over 24 hours so we can cancel now and you'll have it until the end of the month"" - mind you, I've been traveling and out of a house for 4 months and haven't even turned a TV or tried to stream any sports the entire time, and if I ever wanted to, I would have given my money to anyone other then FUBOTV.

I finally had to uninstall this app and bought ""Ip cam viewer"" (full) and found no problems so far with that one. Take my advice, if you have a Kindle Fire, stay away from this app. I do have to add this, the app does work well on my Nexus 7 tablet, but it does NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE DEVICES. If you have another kind of tablet, it is a hit or miss, try the free version first. Better yet, if you have IP cameras and want to be able to choose from a list of good monitoring apps that work, don't buy a Kindle in the first place.

No instructions either. Using the Android app, IP Cam Viewer (a competitor for tinyCam Monitor), the camera brand and model came up automatically as ""Unknown Brand"", ""IPCAM1,IPCAM2"". Everything works perfectly in that app, connected on first try and hasn't had any problems since. I bought tinyCam Monitor Pro, since there was no way to actually try it out (the ""test drive"" amazon thing isn't going to work for actually seeing if the app will connect to a networked camera.... or at least, it wouldn't connect to mine), and I wanted to use the additional motion detection and recording features not found in IP Cam Viewer. However, I can't connect to the camera, I'm assuming since there is no comparable setting to the ""Unknown Brand"" option in IP Cam Viewer, and the app doesn't know how to communicate with it. Everything else is set the same as it is in IP Cam Viewer... same address, port, etc. I've tried all the camera brands/models that I've seen mentioned in the reviews for my camera, but I keep getting ""Video Failed (socket closed)"" and ""Video Failed (404 - not found)"" errors.

I figured out how to set the IP address on my camera so it is not dynamic, then figured out how to use port forwarding on my router, and had to set up a temporary DDNS address for my public IP just to make that happen.  It worked for two days, then a two second power outage reset something and I can't pull up feed on my phone anymore.  I dont feel like figuring it out at this point.The camera I'm using is a Foscam F19893P V2, for reference.The customer service is non existent.  I emailed them several times.

BuyItOnce,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Runs terrible on Fire TV Stick with HD cameras, acceptable on Gen I Fire tablet","Don't see too many reviews of this app for the 1st gen Fire TV stick and specific camera models so adding my experience here. Bought the app since I had good experience with it before on a 2012 Nexus 7 with Foscam 8910W (480P) cameras.Fast forward a few years and i've since added Foscam 9821 (720P) and Amcrest IP2M-841 (1080P) cameras as well and thought over the weekend that it would be nice to be able to see the cams on a large TV via the Fire TV stick.Checked the amazon app store and saw that the app is listed as compatible so without hesitation I bought it given the good experience before. First the good, the scan feature is very good and picked up IP addresses, custom ports, camera make, model correctly for the most part so all I had to do was confirm cameras and enter user name and password. There was a bit of a learning curve to using the fire tv remote to navigate but do able.Now the bad, the 480p cameras worked fine as expected getting about 14-15 fps which is in line with MJPEG camera frame rates; video is reasonably smooth. The 720p cameras were disappointing at 9-10 fps, we're in choppy video territory here now. The 1080p camera was inexcusably bad at ~4 fps, we're talking someone walking across the room looks like they are teleporting 3ft forward at a time. This is all using the built in app's hardware acceleration setting.I reached out to support and he advised that the Fire TV is slow hardware and essentially to lower my resolution on the camera or get better hardware like an Nvidia shield. The Fire TV stick while slow overall can play 1080P videos from Amazon, Netflix, Plex, etc so I think I was somewhat reasonable in my expectation that H264 cameras would work fine with the hardware provided but I guess I was wrong.I will try limiting the app to one camera next to see if that improves the performance.Edit Mar 2017:Removed all the 480P cameras and now only have 2 cameras connected to the app: one 720P Foscam and one 1080P Amcrest, FPS has now improved when in full screen mode: 720P camera fluctuates between 6-10 FPS but seems to stabilize out around 10 FPS, still choppy video overall but usuable as a baby cam and not for any kind of detailed viewing/recording, 1080P camera seems to stabilize around 14-16 FPS and under low motion appears reasonably smooth but again not what you'd want for detailed viewing/recording.When both cameras are on screen in the multicam view, both slow down to about 7 FPS and basically unusable past the point of a series of slow moving pictures but if all you need is any kind of visual like a camera in the garage to verify if the door is open or closed....it'll do.I have the app running on 2 1st gen Fire TV sticks bought at the same time; one seems to like the HW+ decoding better and the other does better in HW mode. Same app, same generation hardware, same cameras, perhaps there are hardware differences inside?The moment I try adding the 480P cameras back in the mix, performance suffers again. I also tried using with just the 1080P cam and it only picked up another 1-2 FPS.Installed the app on a Gen I Fire tablet as well and using with only the 1080P camera in HW mode, am getting 30 FPS in daylight but expect that IR performance at night will likely suffer as well.Conclusion: use with 2 H264 cameras at most on a Gen I Fire TV stick and Gen I Fire tablet. If you have the hardware already like I did, it's ok value to get a little bit of extra utility out of them.",Functionality and Features,

It is very sad to watch.I bought my first Kindle (the generation 3) in late 2010 and immediately fell in love with it. I loaded it up with AmazonÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢s E-books. It was only black and white with limited internet capability but it was a great device. I really liked the chicklet style keyboard. I still have that first kindle today and it is still working. What a fun device!  On the 28th of September 2011, I upgraded to the new Kindle Fire Full Color 7ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ with Multi-touch display and Wi-Fi. This gave me greater connectivity to the internet and the books were slightly easier to read. Finally, in 2013 I ordered the latest Kindle Fire HD 8 (Fifth Generation) which had better contrast and an 8.9ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ screen. Amazon also claimed that it had 15% faster page loads. It has a 167 PPI display and was the lightest Kindle at 5.98 ounces until 2016's Kindle Oasis. This is the one that became my companion. This is the one that is dying at three years old, a mere child. We will get to the culprit who I accuse of committing this slow, painful and tortuous death in just a minute.On the 14th of December this year Amazon sent out an update Fire OS 5.3.2.1. This free software update added the Amazon ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app plus some other general improvements and performance enhancements. Well, since I hadnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t ordered the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app, just before Christmas (22 December 2016), I decided to uninstall the app. My Kindle Fire, which had been operating beautifully in all modes before, now began to display some quirkiness. Just minor annoyances at first: a very slight delay when calling up a book, the battery recharging at a bit slower speed, auto-connect to my Wi-Fi was intermittent, and my Tumblr App was failing to load pictures. Then I made my first mistake (that day). In order to uninstall the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app I went through the normal ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ procedure and found that I could not uninstall or delete the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. I decided I needed a stronger uninstaller and went on the Amazon web site and downloaded an ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂuninstallerÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app. When that didnÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢t work I decided that perhaps I needed a virus checker and malware cleaner. So I went back to the Amazon web site and ordered Malware and Virus Cleaner for Fire devices (OxCleaner) as soon as I ran this one it showed I had several pieces of Malware, Megabytes of trash, and 97 virus errors on my Kindle. For just $4.49 -- it recommended that I down load another app Malware and Virus Cleaner to actually clean up my Kindle. Yet another app Optimizer & Trash Cleaner Tool for Kindle Fire Tablets was also recommended to clean the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtrashÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ as well as the viruses. Like a fool, I bit on this deal and downloaded the $4.49 program. I ran it and within seconds it came back to inform me that everything was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂhunky doryÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ my Kindle was ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgood to goÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. Suddenly, I noticed my Kindle battery was draining much faster than usual but besides that everything seemed okay. Just to make sure I performed a 40 second off/on switch reset to give my Kindle a fresh start.Shortly after this I noticed that one of my books did not open and I called an Amazon Customer service representative. Julius D. was extremely helpful and very patient with me and we spent nearly an hour on the phone as he guided me through several attempts to fix my Kindle. The only area he seemed unfamiliar with was what the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was and how to uninstall it. Outside of that he took me through nearly every procedure possible to fix the device except a total factory reset. After that I contacted two other customer representatives who were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for how to get rid of ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½. It was then that my Kindle began to die. In its death throes it constantly threw up black screens; it seemed to take forever to go from one screen to the next and often just went to black screen; the battery would drain in a matter of minutes and recharging took hours; I had to re-download books that had been there before, it began struggling to open a book and my little kindle just went to a white or black screen. (Choke!) In spite of all the problems I began experiencing with other programs, the persistent ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app just stayed where it was and it would open intermittently. I began to conclude that the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂRapidsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬ÃÂÃÂ¯ÃÂÃÂ¿ÃÂÃÂ½ app was the culprit that was killing my kindle.

This was the first time since I had signed in to Amazon since 1994 that their customer-centric commitment failed. It had failed totally and now my faithful companion, my Kindle, was dying a slow and excruciating death. It had taken the poison pill and there was no antidote.

If these stations don't catch on soon, they will get left behind, like newspapers and video rental companies The Internet has changed everything. NBC can either adapt or become irrelevant.

Unfortunately, it would stream for about 5 minutes then pause and show a buffering icon, there was no way to get the content to continue streaming without restarting. Upon restart everything worked properly again... ...for about five minutes and then everything froze. I repeated this process four times with the same result. My Fire TV's WiFi signal is listed as, ""very good,"" and other streaming services I use (Netflix, PlayStation VUE) worked fine.

I have uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared caches & data, nothing will work. I have contacted both Amazon and NBC Sports support and neither have helped.",User Interface and UX,

At the beginning it worked well, plenty to watch.Then the quality got bad, one one tv the quality was good, other tv the picture would go from clear to blurry.Towards the end of my year, the programming got less and less, golf coverage was limited to featured groups only, never complete coverage of tournaments.

Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs improvement for streaming local sports.,"Downloaded the App to watch my local teams play, but the streaming can be pretty spotty. Sometimes the stream will freeze every few moments and can make the experience unwatchable. I was bouncing back and forth from the Fox Sports app while watching the World Series and only the NBC Sports app gave many any problems...not surprisingly all the commercials play just fine without any interference. I pay for 100 Mbps internet and have been able to stream live sports well from other apps, but the NBC Sports app needs to step it up when it comes to streaming local games.",Performance and Stability,
steve,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the effort,"Olympic coverage is constantly buffering, even during the commercials. And when content is playing, half the time the screen is so blurry it's practically unwatchable. All of these problems occur even though I have average speeds of ~150Mbps, so the bandwidth problem is on NBC's end. Additionally, the app interface is repetitive and difficult to navigate to the content I want to actually see.",User Interface and UX,
